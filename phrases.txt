"Spoiler free review. 0.5106
Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel ''fanboy'' or a DC nerd. -0.5472
The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. 0.6249
I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. 0.0
I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity. 0.0887
That being said, my initial thoughts on Age of Ultron (AoU) are quite negative. -0.6115
To me, its essentially a carbon copy of IM3. 0.0
There are problems which strike you repeatedly as you progress throughout the film. -0.1027
The 2 biggest complaints I have with AoU is 1) the tone (comedy) 2) the script/writing. -0.4019
So starting with the tone. 0.0
I like to laugh as I'm sure most people do, but there is a time and place to exhibit your comedy writing skills in an action film. 0.7876
In AoU, its a constant, recurring and predictable theme. 0.0
It's not limited to one character either, everyone is popping one liner jokes as if its the Expendables and yes, most are not funny. 0.4012
The timing of these moments of levity are horrible too, desensitising the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. -0.9217
If the characters seem so relaxed in not worrying about possibly dying, then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience? 0.7313
This plagued IM3 in a bad way and its arguably worse here. -0.8225
The comic book films which achieved great success in this regard were XMen DOFP, The Avengers 1, Cap 2 even Dark Knight Rises! 0.8439
Can you imagine at the climax of Xmen DOFP if old Magneto and Storm and Bishop start pulling one liner jokes as the army of sentinels came charging at them? 0.25
It would kill any tension! -0.807
2) The script. 0.0
I won't say too much since this is a spoiler free review, but it really feels rushed and unorganised. 0.2846
I watched Fast 7 around 2 weeks before AoU and I got similar vibes. 0.0
Again, its not the fact that the film is 2. 0.0
5 hours long or has too many characters, that isn't am excuse since The Dark Knight and Xmen DOFP shows how to navigate these theatrical obstacles. -0.4257
There are a few completely unnecessary subplots in AoU and useless characters which do not impact the story overall. -0.4215
The villain himself, Ultron is another massive let-down in Marvels already growing catalogue of mishandled villains. -0.6486
So as a summary, if you want mindless action and cool CGI, which this film does offer in the form of some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like AoU. -0.1027
If you are after a darker, grounded and more moving story like the trailers promised, you will be severely disappointed. -0.2111
Final score 6/10 and I am being kind since Cap is my fav Avenger and they finally gave him some good screen time. 0.8519
I have noticed a trend of negative reviews directed at the humor in the movie. -0.3818
Listen. 0.0
. 0.0
. 0.0
humor is subjective. 0.2732
It's also a big part of these types of movies. 0.0
When I read someone criticize the movie because the heroes are dropping one-liners during intense fighting scenes and to them, this downplays the seriousness of the situation or shows a lack of concern for safety from our heroes, I shake my head so hard I get dizzy. -0.1605
This is a comic book movie! 0.0
It's a fantasy/fiction/whatever you want to call it! 0.1511
I'm not a comic book expert, but have been a big fan of the Marvel Universe on film since Iron Man 1. 0.7684
I found the writing in AoU to be sharp and witty. 0.0
And yes, I laughed more than I thought I would. 0.6908
"There's not enough character development"! 0.0
I've seen this in the negative reviews, too. -0.5719
Look, we've had 3 Iron Mans, 2 Captain Americas, 2 Thors, and a Hulk movie to develop the characters. 0.0
At this point, there isn't much more we really need, is there? 0.0
Yes, we see more about Hawkeye's personal side here, but to me, that only feels fair since he's not big enough to carry his own film. 0.5859
And given that he's very much just a human with a great set of physical skills and is less protected and faces his mortality far more than the others do, I felt like it made perfect sense here. 0.9171
We see and learn more about Black Widow in this one, as well. 0.2732
So the complaints about character development don't hold any weight to me. -0.4549
It sounds like the angst of a group of people expecting to see the Empire Strikes Back version of the Avengers. 0.0
In Age of Ultron, we get immediate, sustained action. 0.0
I don't know about you, but if I'm going to watch a movie with a cast of characters that have the abilities of the Avengers, I want to see them in action! 0.501
The creativity of the collaborative fighting was improved as well and was featured much more so than in the first one. 0.6486
That was something that I think the first film lacked, the side by side teamwork. 0.0
This movie held my attention from start to finish. 0.0
As my summary says above, Mjollnir is a pleasantly surprising star of the movie. 0.6369
When you watch it, you'll see why and in my opinion, if you don't enjoy its role here, you really just have a bad attitude! -0.7707
I'll say this: If you don't mind more of the same you'll probably love this movie. 0.6369
If you wanted something different, some change to the Marvel formula, you'll be disappointed. -0.0772
Age of Ultron is pretty much the same movie as the first one. 0.4939
Especially the ending which feels like it follows the first movie beat by beat. 0.3612
There are good, fun moments spread all through the movie, don't get me wrong I liked plenty of stuff in it. 0.8899
The romance between Hulk and Black Widow was interesting, this universe has been weirdly sexless so it was nice to see some tension between the characters. 0.7063
But good moments don't make a good movie. 0.7003
What annoyed me in Age of Ultron was how it just glossed over so many things. -0.3818
The story is extremely thin, even for a superhero movie. 0.0
Tony Stark retired in Iron Man 3 and now he's suddenly back? 0.0
They don't even try to explain his return. 0.0
Tony Stark also creates Ultron, the main bad guy of the movie who goes to cause some major mayhem. -0.34
The movie just glosses over the fact that everything is Stark's fault. -0.4019
Aside Hawkeye there isn't any character development. 0.0
These movies always just seem to be about "setting something up" for the future movies and I think I finally figured it. 0.0
The only thing they're setting up is more characters running around, bigger CGI punching bigger CGI and bigger thing falling from the sky. -0.1531
In the middle of all this it's just so hard to care about anything. 0.3813
All those previous movies build to this? 0.0
Age of Ultron seems to just be in a hurry and jump over the story and get to the CGI punching CGI and oh boy there's plenty of that. 0.0
The Avengers fight an army of generic, faceless and harmless CGI robots for 2 hours, roll credits. 0.2263
I just didn't care. -0.3875
There's no stakes in the action. -0.296
When the characters are just joking around I'm not worried if they'll make it till the next movie. 0.4191
Marvel should have gotten serious in Age of Ultron. 0.3612
You can be serious without being all "dark and gritty" too. -0.0772
Joss Whedon said he was influenced by Empire Strikes Back and Godfather Part 2. -0.3612
Joss Whedon promised we'd see some superhero blood. 0.3612
Joss Whedon failed. -0.5106
There's no one word that can some up this movie. -0.296
I won't use 'eh' because that's a bit too vague, and I think it's a bit better than that. 0.3612
But things like 'good' or 'amazing' are too crazy to use. 0.0258
Welcome to my review. 0.4588
Age of Ultron opens to a fine start -in fact, an amazing start- with a fresh, intense, action-packed sequence. 0.802
The Avengers are introduced for the sequel, and so are two new characters: Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. -0.3612
These ended up being my favourite (Yes, I'm spelling it right. 0.0
I'm not American, y'know) characters in this movie. 0.0
Unfortunately, they get tossed a side a bit. -0.34
Considering they're new characters, and considering one is in an upcoming movie and the other dies, they should have gotten more development. 0.0
I adored Scarlet Witch and her powers, at least in the parts that she's ACTUALLY IN. 0.0772
After the opening, everything goes downhill, at least SLIGHTLY. 0.0
Ultron's introduction is quite terrible. -0.5256
Can anyone explain to me how this invisible force can suddenly SPEAK inside a whole load of technological material? 0.0
I don't know. 0.0
. 0.0
. 0.0
It just felt pretty dumb to me. -0.0258
If this was how it was in the comics, then I suppose I can't really complain much. 0.3241
But I guess I could say that it doesn't translate to screen very well. 0.3384
After that, the movie becomes kind of dull. -0.4576
I kept twitching in my seat various different times. 0.0
If I can say one thing, it's that the action sequences were fantastic, and they're the only things that hold this movie up. 0.5574
Ultron was nothing like he was in the teaser trailer that got me hyped, nor was the movie. -0.4784
I wanted a dark, gritty, intense, heart-breaking, half-horror movie! 0.1511
The advertising for this movie is false, almost to the point where I could sue. 0.0
Remember Scarlet's gut-wrenching scream, or maybe Ultron saying "There's no strings on me" in the teaser trailer? -0.7096
Well guess what? 0.2732
Nowhere to be found. 0.0
But there's one last thing that makes me feel at least a bit satisfied with the movie, and that was the last act. 0.4215
When Ultron's plans were finally revealed, everything turned amazing. 0.5859
The CGI effects were absolutely incredible, and there are shots in the trailers that would reveal his plan if they were extended by a few seconds, so keep an eye out. 0.0

By the end of this review, I can finally figure out one word to sum this up. 0.0
'Overrated. 0.0
'     You can mark this review as unhelpful, but I don't care. -0.5334
It's my opinion. 0.0
This movie is definitely NOT a must see, but I guess it is for any fans of the comics. 0.2144
Just be prepared for a completely different film to the film marketed in the trailers. 0.2263

EDIT:         So I was sippy sipping on my mug of tea and I almost spat it out all over my screen. 0.0
This movie is rated 7. 0.0
9. 0.0
I have now changed my 6/10 rating to 1/10 simply to try and lower the rating to what it deserves. -0.296
Before you Marvel nerds attack me, I am doing this because this movie is average at most. -0.0772
You are crazy if you rate it higher than 6. -0.34

Avengers age of Ultron is by far the best Marvel movie to date. 0.7906
It has all the elements of the first movie, but steps it up in the action, character and dialog. 0.0
I went into this movie with very unrealistically high expectations. 0.0
So when I saw this movie, I was very worried but excited. 0.4116
All the cast from the previous Avengers movie all reprise their roles. 0.0
Robert Downey Juinor was amazing as Ironman. 0.5859
Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth were both great as Captain America and the mighty Thor. 0.6249
Scarlett Johanson was brilliant as Black Widow and was even more bad-ass in this movie, than any of her other films. 0.5859
Her role was substantially bigger this time around. 0.0
This can also be said about Hawkeye, who's role was way bigger in this movie. 0.0
In fact, Hawkeye even has some of the best lines and the best action sequences. 0.8555
Mark ruffilo was once again amazing as Hulk and Bruce Banner. 0.5859
The one character that stole the show, would be James Spader. 0.0
He embodies an evil AI robot perfectly. -0.0516
He can be really calm and yet menacing and sometimes he can be full of rage and anger. -0.6915
Aron Taylor Johnson and Elisibeth Olsin are also a great new edition to the marvel universe. 0.7845
The scarlet Witch character has a big part in the film also. -0.3612
The action has been dialed up and the set pieces are bigger and better. 0.4404
The cgi can seem a little off at times, but other than that, it looks fantastic. 0.7096
The movie also spends time on the relationships and past of some characters, which leads to some great character moments. 0.6249
This is much more emotional, than the first movie. 0.2247
I would defiantly say that this movie is better than the first Avengers Movie! 0.4926
Well, the superhero movies have sucked their last dollar out of me. -0.2263
I don't like watching movies just to see things blown up. -0.2755
The writers and director are so much into showing off their destructive action sequences that they didn't pause to consider whether soneone would actually give an F. Superthin plot. -0.6124
The occasional quip grom Ultron or an Avenger gets old quick with nothing else to support it. -0.3089
We're clearly dealing with high school humor here. 0.5859
I really like the scene where the earth is caving in, thousands of people obviously meeting gruesome deaths, and yet a few Avengers take the time to save one woman in a falling vehicle. 0.659
