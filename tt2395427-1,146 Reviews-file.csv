1,Grossly underwhelming (spoiler free),charzhino,"Spoiler free review. Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel ''fanboy'' or a DC nerd. The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity.<br><br>That being said, my initial thoughts on Age of Ultron (AoU) are quite negative. To me, its essentially a carbon copy of IM3. There are problems which strike you repeatedly as you progress throughout the film. The 2 biggest complaints I have with AoU is 1) the tone (comedy) 2) the script/writing.<br><br>So starting with the tone. I like to laugh as I'm sure most people do, but there is a time and place to exhibit your comedy writing skills in an action film. In AoU, its a constant, recurring and predictable theme. It's not limited to one character either, everyone is popping one liner jokes as if its the Expendables and yes, most are not funny. The timing of these moments of levity are horrible too, desensitising the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed in not worrying about possibly dying, then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience? This plagued IM3 in a bad way and its arguably worse here. The comic book films which achieved great success in this regard were XMen DOFP, The Avengers 1, Cap 2 even Dark Knight Rises! Can you imagine at the climax of Xmen DOFP if old Magneto and Storm and Bishop start pulling one liner jokes as the army of sentinels came charging at them? It would kill any tension! 2) The script. I won't say too much since this is a spoiler free review, but it really feels rushed and unorganised. I watched Fast 7 around 2 weeks before AoU and I got similar vibes. Again, its not the fact that the film is 2.5 hours long or has too many characters, that isn't am excuse since The Dark Knight and Xmen DOFP shows how to navigate these theatrical obstacles. There are a few completely unnecessary subplots in AoU and useless characters which do not impact the story overall. The villain himself, Ultron is another massive let-down in Marvels already growing catalogue of mishandled villains.<br><br>So as a summary, if you want mindless action and cool CGI, which this film does offer in the form of some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like AoU. If you are after a darker, grounded and more moving story like the trailers promised, you will be severely disappointed. Final score 6/10 and I am being kind since Cap is my fav Avenger and they finally gave him some good screen time.",25 April 2015
2,"What a Shame, we live where Studio's take control",Sam smith (sam_smithreview),"being a huge Marvel fan, and also Josh Whedon fan I was super excited for him to come back and do another Avengers movie. The first film was pretty brilliant. But with this film, Whedon wasn't given much air to breathe, with constant Studio interference and orders of certain shots to be re- done, or scrapped if not worse. Put in.<br><br>So, you thinking why is this film so bad, if you are a fan, you should love it. Well the film changes pace, very quickly and abruptly, which is a poor sign of movie making. The Characters do not act like they would usually act in the same scenario, the progression of the story is all over the place, Scene's that just have no weight or meaning to the film, but in there because it looks cool or is setting up another independent super hero movie, the Villain that is so smart, but doesn't use the internet and his ability to control everything just to wipe out everybody, but rather has this ridiculously stupid plan. The Hero's that are suppose to be smart, intelligent and some what Spanish do not see all of the stupid plot hole that get infiltrated. <br><br>The fighting was also a problem for me, it was the same. Once you saw it in the first Avengers, you see exact same thing in the second one too, and it doesn't even change a little.<br><br>Overall, this film is bunched up due to the constant interference by Studio as Josh has stated so many times now.",26 April 2016
3,Same as the first movie (but with robots),matt_hew,"It's quite an achievement to make a boring Superhero Movie so well done to all involved.<br><br>Remember the first average at best Avengers Movie? A baddie in control of the Tesseract uses it and an alien army to try and take over the planet. Whilst this is happening the Avengers are brought together where there are a few internal issues involving having their minds controlled &amp;/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat the alien threat.<br><br>Well.... <br><br>This movie is about a baddie who was in control of the Tesseract which then becomes the catalyst for a new robot baddie and it's robot army trying to destroy the planet. This again creates a few internal issues involving the Avengers having their minds controlled &amp;/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat the robot threat. <br><br>It's just the same movie repackaged (again) which tries to be intelligent but comes across as dull. <br><br>Some of the Avengers presence have little or no no point in being in the movie (Hawkeye just being there for example to offer the others a weekend retreat to go to).<br><br>But as with the first movie and the upcoming Captain America: Civil War it seems as long as the movie is crammed full of as many Superheroes as possible and they all kick off at some point during the movie, then this is enough to keep an audience happy.<br><br>Stick with the X-Men at least they make an effort!",10 May 2016
4,"Behold, the world's largest conveyor belt",tieman64,"""People stopped being people in 1913. That was the year Henry Ford put his cars on rollers and made his workers adopt the speed of the assembly line. At first, workers rebelled. They quit in droves. Now we plug right into repetitive motions of a hundred kinds."" - Jeffrey Eugenides <br><br>Produced by Marvel Studios (now a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company), ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a gazillion dollar superhero movie. Most of the film consists of dull, unimaginative action sequences in which powerful ""good warriors"" battle powerful ""bad warriors"". These action sequences - which have no sense of style, tempo and which are totally devoid of tension - are rolled out like crude, Pavlovian commands; the chemical rushes cynically demanded by corporate candy factories.<br><br>Breaking up the monotony of these monotonous actions sequences are equally monotonous and equally mechanical scenes in which our heroes ""talk"", ""reveal their personalities"" and ""share their feelings"". These scenes exist, not because Marvel Studios has any interest in drama, characters or continuity, but because ""films are supposed to have these scenes"". In the Marvel universe, nothing really matters. The individual plots and over-arching plot lines of Marvel's films don't matter. Characters don't matter. These things are only present to present the illusion of storytelling. They are filler. The constituents of a factory assembly line whose sole goal is the procurement of money.<br><br>You can't have a Marvel Movie without a super-villain. This time around our villain's a Really Bad Guy who wants to do Really Bad Stuff and who ironically pokes fun at Conventional Movie Villain Dialgoue whilst actually totally adhering to clich√©s. This villain (spoiler?) is defeated. Along the way, the film ""comically"" delivers its obligatory ""one swear word"", but not before a room full of lawyers and marketing executives run up the data, salivate over pie-charts and double check with global ratings boards.<br><br>Marvel Studios has a history of roping in ""irreverent"" and ""edgy"" directors. Afterall, you can't sell cookie cuttered dough to zombies without pretending it's the work of a rebel. As such, ""Age of Ultron"" was directed by Joss Whedon, a geek-king with a flair for zany dialogue. But like Tarantinospeak, Woody Allenspeak, Mametspeak and Coenspeak, Joss Whedonspeak is now officially annoying. Indeed, everyone in Whedon's ""Ultron"" now sports the same voice. Every character, be they villain, hero, co-star, robot or computer, is an ironic, sarcastic, wisecracking master of zany one liners. This orgy of flippancy, non-sequiturs and ""cool dialogue"" reeks of desperation; cool stops being cool when everyone speaks cool.<br><br>Watching most Marvel Movies is a bit like being forced to watch a pornographic movie for a full two hours past the point of ejaculation. ""Ultron"" in particular bludgeons you with bludgeoning. It's filled with CGI muscle-men pounding and stomping, blowing up buildings and tossing cars back and forth, and then doing it again, and again and again and again, and then again in the sequels and then again on the directors' cuts, and then again in the reboots, and then again in the reboots' sequels and then again and again. And then a few more times. And then again and again.<br><br>Today, Marvel Studios now rolls like one of the world's largest conveyor belts; factory film-making as the epitome of the self-perpetuating capitalist machine, repackaging and marketing to every inch of the world. Art subservient to product cycles, product obsolescence and schizoid brains. And all the while, the Studio keeps expanding, pushing their movies in the summer, their TV shows in the fall/winter, and their streaming shows in the spring before the cycle is repeated all over again. With the new mantra of #ItsAllConnected - ironic, considering no Marvel show/series meaningfully connects to another - Marvel moves like the cinematic equivalent of malware. And now that Disney's acquired the ""Star Wars"" franchise, we can expect it to similarly start squeezing new ""Star Wars"" movies out of its mechanical orifices like diseased clockwork.<br><br>Incidentally, like most recent Marvel movies, ""Age of Ultron's"" chief villain is essentially a Western defence contract run amok. So we have another ""anti violence"", ""anti military"" Marvel film which gets its kicks from violence, mass murder and the flattering of whole cities. Lazily written and acted, the film finds actor Mark Ruffalo continuing to be excellent, soulful and layered. He plays the Hulk, a property damage loving green dude with magical pants.<br><br>3/10 ¬ñ What was Ultron's age anyway? Was that dude even legal? Worth no viewings.",5 March 2016
5,One word:  Mjollnir!,Michael Metcalfe,"I have noticed a trend of negative reviews directed at the humor in the movie. Listen...humor is subjective. It's also a big part of these types of movies. When I read someone criticize the movie because the heroes are dropping one-liners during intense fighting scenes and to them, this downplays the seriousness of the situation or shows a lack of concern for safety from our heroes, I shake my head so hard I get dizzy.<br><br>This is a comic book movie! It's a fantasy/fiction/whatever you want to call it! I'm not a comic book expert, but have been a big fan of the Marvel Universe on film since Iron Man 1. I found the writing in AoU to be sharp and witty. And yes, I laughed more than I thought I would. <br><br>""There's not enough character development!"" I've seen this in the negative reviews, too. Look, we've had 3 Iron Mans, 2 Captain Americas, 2 Thors, and a Hulk movie to develop the characters. At this point, there isn't much more we really need, is there? Yes, we see more about Hawkeye's personal side here, but to me, that only feels fair since he's not big enough to carry his own film. And given that he's very much just a human with a great set of physical skills and is less protected and faces his mortality far more than the others do, I felt like it made perfect sense here. We see and learn more about Black Widow in this one, as well. So the complaints about character development don't hold any weight to me. It sounds like the angst of a group of people expecting to see the Empire Strikes Back version of the Avengers. <br><br>In Age of Ultron, we get immediate, sustained action. I don't know about you, but if I'm going to watch a movie with a cast of characters that have the abilities of the Avengers, I want to see them in action! The creativity of the collaborative fighting was improved as well and was featured much more so than in the first one. That was something that I think the first film lacked, the side by side teamwork. This movie held my attention from start to finish. <br><br>As my summary says above, Mjollnir is a pleasantly surprising star of the movie. When you watch it, you'll see why and in my opinion, if you don't enjoy its role here, you really just have a bad attitude!",1 May 2015
6,The son of Megatron and Skynet meets Tony Stark and his Amazing Friends,xamtaro,"In 2012, there came a day unlike any other day where the worlds greatest heroes were united against a common threat and THE AVENGERS blew away audiences of all ages with the first ever comic book movie crossover. In 2015, there came another day unlike any other day and this time the world is threatened by a Ultron, the cynical critical atypical child of Skynet and Megatron...... No actually he's just a wisecracking artificial intelligence with delusions of godhood and all round evil. Turning on his creators, he threatens all life on earth with his sidekicks ""illusion- woman"" and ""not-the-flash""....I mean, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and it is up to the Avengers to take him out before he can usher in THE AGE OF ULTRON. <br><br>Instead of the robot dominated dystopian future that we saw in the comics, what we do get is more ""the next few days of Ultron"". No matter, it is an exciting few days with director Joss Whedon balancing the intercharacter dynamics with awesome action pieces from claustrophobic close combat, to a freeway chase, to the much advertised no holds barred beat down between the Hulk and iron man's new ""hulk buster"" Armour. All this is supplemented with beautiful special effects from Industrial Lights and Magic ILM. Flawless work befitting the movie's massive Budget.<br><br>In The villain, Ultron, the Writers have crafted a memorable though under utilised bad guy. Ultron could have been the vehicle to explore deeper themes, themes that were merely hinted at but never fleshed out. Instead, His cynical yet refined snarling courtesy of James Spader reminds me of the those magnificently passionate Super villains that were so common in Saturday morning cartoons of old.<br><br>And that is exactly what this is. AGE OF ULTRON can be described as a true live action cartoon. The dialogue is light hearted, the story is straightforward, the tone is fun and the action is immense. And this is not exactly a good thing. Intense scenes are interrupted and spoilt with poorly placed humour and once again the story does not seem to take itself seriously. <br><br>Fights are over-choreographed, more like some fancy ballet than an all out battle. The fact that it cuts to graceful slow motion once in a while only emphasises the dance like nature of the fights. <br><br>And yet the movie felt like pieces of it were cut out. The narrative does not flow as smoothly as the first with inexplicable scenes like Thor suddenly going off on his hallucination trip. Much of the premise and the characters development up to this point very much depends on the viewer watching prior marvel movies. <br><br>It is here that Marvel studio's continuity heavy Creative direction rears its ugly head. To know what is going on in this movie, one would have to watch the previous movies. Captain America the winter soldier, iron man 3, the first avengers movie. But perhaps that's the point? Force people to go buy the Blu rays or the video to rewatch and get up to speed. In the end, the real big winner is distributor Disney. Ka-Ching $$.<br><br>I like a good comedy. In in a big action blockbuster, I like to believe that the stakes are real, that the dangers faced by our heroes are real, that they are really fighting for the fate of the world. Instead, we get this cartoony violence, with equally cartoony superficial story, where heroes joke around with quick lighthearted quips in the middle of a fight scene where people could die. This kills tension. And if it weren't for the magnificent effects, action and direction, AGE OF ULTRON would have scored a bit lower.",14 December 2015
7,Felt so bland,dvoon-missy-mcmuffin,"Everything seems so bland. The constant jibe of who gets the last word in seems forced, predictable and acts like an edit for the next scene. Coming out of the screening, there is not one scene or moment that i feel that i can walk away with in awe.<br><br>The romantic angle that was introduced lack chemistry. From out of nowhere, the characters involved suddenly had an interest for one another? Without any build up of it in past movies nor in this one, it just felt empty.<br><br>Camera angles that were purposefully shot for the intentional thrill of 3D is like any other angles used in any other 3D-movie-going-experience. I wonder when will this gimmick/trend go away.<br><br>All in all...it is still watchable. It just left a disdain taste of yet another repetition of the Marvel formula. Age of Ultron neither has the quality and magic of both Guardians of the Galaxy or Captain America Winter Soldier had.",23 April 2015
8,No one was more disappointed than me,pinkled5,"It hurts to rate this so poorly, but it certainly deserves the low marks. There were so many things that ruined this movie for me.<br><br>1) The Storytelling - Or lack thereof. There was not a compelling story to be told here. Ultron wants to blow up the world, the Avengers try to stop him. That's all the audience ever really knows about this story and it felt flat and unfulfilling.<br><br>2) Plot? - The movie opens with our heroes in the middle of a battle for reasons that are largely unimportant. That pretty much sums up this whole film<br><br>3) The Love Interest - Totally underdeveloped. We're basically told by the script writer that these two people are in love, but never are we SHOWN that they're falling in love. It rang completely hollow.<br><br>4) The Humor - There were WAY too many jokes in this movie, and that wouldn't have been all that bad if so many of them weren't eye rollers. Many of them left me groaning.<br><br>5) Ultron - This guy appears out of nowhere and is woefully underdeveloped. Plus, he's supposed to be some kind of AI but he's constantly cracking off stupid one-liners and making facial expressions that I thought were inconsistent with what and who he was supposed to be.<br><br>6) Character Overload - There were WAY too many characters to do any of them any justice. I would have liked the film to focus on a smaller group of characters and their relationships with one another, instead, we got a who's who of the entire Marvel universe leaving a lot to be desired.<br><br>I could go on, but my heart is still aching and I don't want to talk about it anymore. I see that a lot of people liked it and I'm happy that they did. I only wish it hadn't been such a colossal disappointment for me.",1 May 2015
9,If you listen very closely you can hear the sound of the superhero bubble bursting.,white_water,"I'll say this: If you don't mind more of the same you'll probably love this movie. If you wanted something different, some change to the Marvel formula, you'll be disappointed. Age of Ultron is pretty much the same movie as the first one. Especially the ending which feels like it follows the first movie beat by beat.<br><br>There are good, fun moments spread all through the movie, don't get me wrong I liked plenty of stuff in it. The romance between Hulk and Black Widow was interesting, this universe has been weirdly sexless so it was nice to see some tension between the characters. But good moments don't make a good movie. What annoyed me in Age of Ultron was how it just glossed over so many things. The story is extremely thin, even for a superhero movie.<br><br>Tony Stark retired in Iron Man 3 and now he's suddenly back? They don't even try to explain his return. Tony Stark also creates Ultron, the main bad guy of the movie who goes to cause some major mayhem. The movie just glosses over the fact that everything is Stark's fault. Aside Hawkeye there isn't any character development. These movies always just seem to be about ""setting something up"" for the future movies and I think I finally figured it. The only thing they're setting up is more characters running around, bigger CGI punching bigger CGI and bigger thing falling from the sky. In the middle of all this it's just so hard to care about anything. All those previous movies build to this?<br><br>Age of Ultron seems to just be in a hurry and jump over the story and get to the CGI punching CGI and oh boy there's plenty of that. The Avengers fight an army of generic, faceless and harmless CGI robots for 2 hours, roll credits. I just didn't care. There's no stakes in the action. When the characters are just joking around I'm not worried if they'll make it till the next movie.<br><br>Marvel should have gotten serious in Age of Ultron. You can be serious without being all ""dark and gritty"" too. Joss Whedon said he was influenced by Empire Strikes Back and Godfather Part 2. Joss Whedon promised we'd see some superhero blood. Joss Whedon failed.",23 April 2015
10,this movie was simply an insult to superhero movies in general,keiran-cox,"Never watch this movie it is an insult to the superhero movie category. Their is simply nothing good about this movie the scene were they are drinking and chilling was OK but 99% of the film was cringy and simply bad it ignored all sense of relationships or personal lives the characters may have and pited them against a hastily put together villain with the personality of a child who often had looney tunes references and scenes, for example near the end Ultron is about to be hit by the hulk and the whole world pauses while he has some cringy unfunny one liner along the lines of ""hey how about we call it a truce"" then he is punched away into the distance as the world starts back up again it felt like the director had fallen asleep watching a wille e coyote cartoon the night before filming this scene.<br><br>The visuals were as great as ever but their comes a time when explosions and different coloured iron man suits don't progress the narrative look at the later transformer movies they made a lot of money yet are awful films, it is disheartening that this trash is the highest grossing superhero movie. The scripts are pathetic the MCU isn't known for good script writing but this film is the worst of the worst every single sentence feels like they are trying to get a cheap laugh out of the audience and that might be OK if it was just iron man up to it but its not every single hero and the villain are cracking wise in every single scene and it isn't funny anymore the script writers need to be sacked it just reminds you of green lanterns cringy script in his standalone. <br><br>A couple of the biggest mistakes in this movie from the endless list of flaws would be how they killed off quicksilver... as any comic fan knows you simply cannot kill a speedster with bullets it is the dumbest way to get rid of such a character and this film did it proud by making the stupidest portrayal of a speedster of screen their has been. They didn't only mess up the characters origin because they don't own the rights to the xmen which could be forgiven but they then released the movie along side his actual portrayal in xmen Days of future past and then went on to kill him off in the same movie he was introduced in i mean really? Visions introduction in this movie has to be one the most forced origin stories i have seen it didn't fit at all with the narrative and they just kept pushing it down the audience throats it was very poorly handled but as spiderman now holds the throne for worst introduction into a superhero movie after Civil Wars lame ass representation of the character it is less shocking as it seems like the norm for the MCU to not give a crap about their characters :'(",11 July 2016
11,Avengers Age of Ultron is a dream come true. Great Sequel Indeed!,Sal Bando,"Yes, the Avengers Age of Ultron is a dream come true. This is exactly the sequel to a great film that we have been dreaming about. It's superb on every single level. It honestly has no real flaws that I could see. How great does a movie have to be given the inherent difficulties in making a film like this in the first place? Writer/director Joss Whedon did an admirable job of balancing the screen time of the sprawling and expanding cast.<br><br>As for the new characters, I loved what they did with The Vision and how they did it. The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver ¬ó aka, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff are amazing as well. Wanda's psychic powers are much more complicated and empathetic then I expected them to be. What I love about Wanda is that she physically goes through emotional trauma when she uses certain powers and we as the audience go with her on that emotional journey. Like just about everything this film, that really packs a punch.<br><br>Marvel's done a great of making its superhero movies about the title characters more than the villains. In both team films now, the bad guy has stepped up and been phenomenal. Both films delivered true treats. This movie actually tops the first in scope and drama and that's in no small part to a superb villain. I feel that Ultron tops any bad guy since Darth Vader himself. His presence, manipulation and motivation leads to the best action sequences ever put to film. It also leads to an intriguing story and remarkable performances as this fine cast is allowed to flex their emotional muscles as well as their superhero muscles. <br><br>I can say without hesitation that movies just don't get better than this one sequel or otherwise.",14 April 2015
12,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is a damn good Superhero flick, excellent sequel!",ivo-cobra8,"Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is a MARVEL damn good superhero flick and an excellent sequel! Yes it is miles way better than Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Terminator Genisys I have enjoyed this film much better than Jurassic World, Star Wars and Terminator the new movies. <br><br>This film is fun, popcorn, Action and entertaining action sequel flick. I like the first one but I love this one much more. The first time I watch it, I did not like this film at all, it did not work for me, but the second time around this flick was awesome and it become one of my favorite MARVEL superhero movies. I love this film so much, more than the first Avengers. James Spader made the movie for me! So much better than Loki. <br><br>
James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. played together in a teen movie Tuff Turf in 1985 and 30 years later they teamed together to star in a MARVEL comic book super hero film. I like Tuff Turf but Avengers: Age of Ultron is far way better film to me. I love this film so much and I will never get the backlash. Joss Whedon gave me everything I wanted in a sequel. This and the first film are in my top 10 films of all time. <br><br>I waited a long time for this universe and I am loving every minute of it. Superhero movies come out all time but something like this is what I love about movies. <br><br>
Plot: Tony Stark creates the Ultron Program to protect the world, but when the peace-keeping program becomes hostile, The Avengers go into action to try and defeat a virtually impossible enemy's to get. Earth's mightiest heroes must come together once again to protect the world from global extinction. <br><br>I really enjoy this movie I don't get the backslash and a lot of people were disappointed with this sequel that it is not so good as the first film. Age of Ultron is in my top 3 favorite comic book films. Number 1 will always be Captain America: The Winter Soldier and number 2 will be Captain America: The First Avenger, I just love those two films: Captain America is my favorite superhero character in MARVEL comic books. <br><br>Captain America in this movie is the most decent hero in this movie, he did not want the leave the island with people stuck on it, he refused too, I have seen a hero in him. <br><br>People are keep getting upset over Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), ""oh look what they did with Black Widow."" I saw the film and I am seeing her kicking ass or calm down the Hulk, which is a pretty ballsy thing to do. Specially for someone who has no balls and she is kicking ass and driving motorcycle, driving around shooting for Cap, helping them to get vision android to beat Ultron and she is the only one with no powers, except Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), she has the to get the thing for them. I think it would be weird to kidnapped Thor, if you put Thor in the scene duh. I enjoy this movie much more than the first film, the first film I liked okay, I like the first Avengers film. This is a fun popcorn entertainment flick that I really love. <br><br>
I like the romance between Black Widow with Hulk it was really good fast paced entertainment. I love Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch I like the twist by the end of the film that she turn her side around when she found out that Ultron wants to destroy everything on this planet I love that. You have Aaron Taylor-Johnson in it from Kick-Ass film as Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver sadly he dies on the end of the film, but he saves Hawkeye and a kid from Ultron firing bunch of bullets on them I thought that was pretty decent in the film. In my opinion Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a good job playing his character. I love that they return Samuel L. Jackson to the movie back as Nick Fury and that he help them out fighting Ultron. James Spader did a terrific excellent job playing Ultron.<br><br>Avengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and the eleventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). <br><br>You have a lot of action in it, I also love that Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton work together after Ultron failed to destroy them and they go in to safe house to Clinton's family, I like that. When Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) touches Black Widow, Iron Man and Thor I like that you see a background of Natasha Romanoff's childhood, I like that. I love the African shipyard you see them on a ship and I love the last stand. I love that the Vision helps Avengers to destroy and stop Ultron from extinction. Btw I love to death Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) she is so beautiful and charming I love her.
Overall: I am giving this flick 10 out of 10 for me Age of Ultron is my #3 favorite super hero movie. I can't wait for the next movie: Captain America: Civil War.",8 May 2016
13,Remember the amazing teaser trailer? Expect the opposite.,TonightTurnYourWeaponsToSnow,"There's no one word that can some up this movie. I won't use 'eh' because that's a bit too vague, and I think it's a bit better than that. But things like 'good' or 'amazing' are too crazy to use. Welcome to my review.<br><br>Age of Ultron opens to a fine start -in fact, an amazing start- with a fresh, intense, action-packed sequence. The Avengers are introduced for the sequel, and so are two new characters: Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. These ended up being my favourite (Yes, I'm spelling it right. I'm not American, y'know) characters in this movie. Unfortunately, they get tossed a side a bit. Considering they're new characters, and considering one is in an upcoming movie and the other dies, they should have gotten more development. I adored Scarlet Witch and her powers, at least in the parts that she's ACTUALLY IN.<br><br>After the opening, everything goes downhill, at least SLIGHTLY. Ultron's introduction is quite terrible. Can anyone explain to me how this invisible force can suddenly SPEAK inside a whole load of technological material? I don't know... It just felt pretty dumb to me. If this was how it was in the comics, then I suppose I can't really complain much. But I guess I could say that it doesn't translate to screen very well. <br><br>After that, the movie becomes kind of dull. I kept twitching in my seat various different times. If I can say one thing, it's that the action sequences were fantastic, and they're the only things that hold this movie up. Ultron was nothing like he was in the teaser trailer that got me hyped, nor was the movie. I wanted a dark, gritty, intense, heart-breaking, half-horror movie! The advertising for this movie is false, almost to the point where I could sue. Remember Scarlet's gut-wrenching scream, or maybe Ultron saying ""There's no strings on me"" in the teaser trailer? Well guess what? Nowhere to be found. <br><br>But there's one last thing that makes me feel at least a bit satisfied with the movie, and that was the last act. When Ultron's plans were finally revealed, everything turned amazing. The CGI effects were absolutely incredible, and there are shots in the trailers that would reveal his plan if they were extended by a few seconds, so keep an eye out...<br><br>By the end of this review, I can finally figure out one word to sum this up.

Thank you for reading, and I know that at least somebody will agree with me.<br><br>EDIT:<br><br>So I was sippy sipping on my mug of tea and I almost spat it out all over my screen.

14,Somewhat disappointed,kaianmattmckay,"I'm a big fan of Marvel and have seen the other Avengers titles, and so I went into this one with certain expectations. They weren't met.<br><br>As opposed to earlier installments, barely a few minutes seem to pass in AoU without one of the characters making what is supposed to be an amusing, throwaway remark/one-liner. There's nothing wrong with injecting a little levity into the proceedings, but in this case, I found it excessive, and detrimental both to the flow of action and to the characters and how you engage. Wisecracking is usually one character's responsibility, specifically to provide comic relief. When all the characters are doing it, it gets tired very quickly.<br><br>I found the plot to be a bit messy, perhaps because I'm a comics purist, and the introduction and treatment of several new characters here is only tangentially related, if even that, to their actual origin stories as per the comics. With apologies to James Spader, I found the portrayal of Ultron in particular to be bordering on the ridiculous, and inappropriately ""human"", as in my imaginings, Ultron was always more of a Terminator-style killing machine with tyrannical tendencies, whereas we're presented here with more of a lovable but psychotic rogue with as much dangerous charm as he has nuts and bolts. The whole effort seems to be held together by an abundance of action, new characters, and cameos from previous characters (Samuel L. Jackson, or Idris Elba) to distract from the general lack of substance.<br><br>All in all, it was 2+ hours that I don't totally regret spending, but would not see it again, or recommend it - unless it's just for the voyeuristic pleasure of seeing your favourite eye-candy protagonists in biker leathers and latex.",13 February 2017
15,Great Film. It easily fulfilled and the exceeded all of my expectations.,Ronald,"The humor, angst and drama are remarkable for a superhero film. In fact, most will consider them remarkable for any type of movie. I can't think of a weak moment in the film, as it is strong from beginning to end. <br><br>Anyone doubting that this entire cast (new and old) couldn't work well together or that characters would be cheated out of screen time need not worry. EVERYONE gets to shine. Downey as well as Evans are Oscar caliber good in this movie. (Setting up what has to be an amazing next installment in ""Civil War"") All the performances are straight to the point perfect. Hulk is again perfect in his CG transformation and Spader's Ultron uses his wonderful voice and mannerisms to perfection. Each new character is exquisitely cast and the old school guard has never been better. That includes RDJ as Tony Stark. We all loved what we've seen before from him and this evolution of Stark is even more intriguing. Elizabeth Olsen gives one of the best new character portrayals in recent years. People are going to want to see a LOT more of her Scarlet Witch in the future. Also, Jeremy Renner is finally given Hawkeye material worthy of his abilities and worthy of the character itself. He truly does steal more than one scene and has some of the best one-liners imaginable. <br><br>This easily fulfilled and the exceeded all of my expectations. I can't wait to see where they branch the Avengers team and concept from this point forward. There are so many great possibilities. This really is everything anyone would want in a movie. It delivers everything I had hoped to see and quite a bit that I didn't even think possible.",15 April 2015
16,One Big Joke,Eric Slattery,"This movie was a failure on many levels. There was a serious lack of story, the humor was very forced in an overabundance of one-liners, bad CGI in some places, and a very under-developed Villain. The movie focused a lot on the characters in the movie and developing them, but not even that much. We get a few tidbits about each, except Thor, Stark/Ironman, and Hulk/Banner. Thor was hardly in the movie, only shown on screen for a few minutes after leaving the team to basically setup the next movie and where the story is going (Infinity War), but is glossed over so quickly most people won't catch it, especially those who have no idea about story arcs in the comics. Ultron's reveal was absolutely perfect, it set him up as an intimidating and powerful villain, then when he gets his own mechanical body, he turns into a comedy act and does not look real because the CGI metal looks terrible, along with the stupid moving mouth when he speaks.<br><br>Every character in the movie was trying to be a comedian in the movie. The only moment that felt serious or dire was the reveal of Ultron (and then turned into a joke later). The ending of course has a big battle with all the Ultron bots, but seriously, why do they even have Thor in the close quarters fighting with them? His lightning could have fried most of them, then they have Thor not fight Ultron back just so Vision (Which they never called him by his name) could be seen holding Thor's hammer again and make a stupid remark about the balance of the hammer.<br><br>Stark/Ironman is basically having amnesia forgetting the events of Ironman 3. And then turns into a ""mad scientist"" with Banner to create Ultron, totally against his way of thinking after the events of Ironman 3. Ironman also does everything he knows the team will get mad at him for doing, but does it anyway without consulting them.<br><br>Black Widow is basically the Avengers ""Mattress"" in that she is now flirting with a 4th Avenger (1st was Ironman in Ironman 2, 2nd was Hawkeye in The Avengers, 3rd was Captain America in The Winter Soldier) and now the 4th is Bruce Banner/Hulk. She is a better character than that, but all she gets is flirting with everyone.<br><br>We are introduced to 2 other characters dubbed ""The Twins"" though they never give them names. Probably because of Fox owns the rights to X-Men, but their names are Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Quicksilver dies, and of course, says a one-liner, and yet we feel nothing for his death as we never knew him......he is a 1- dimensional character. At least in X-Men Day of Future Past we get to know Quicksilver in there, and his special effects were a hell of a lot better.<br><br>This film was a catastrophe, and should not be praised in anyway.",4 May 2015
17,Better then the first!,Mr. Potato Movies,"Avengers age of Ultron is by far the best Marvel movie to date. It has all the elements of the first movie, but steps it up in the action, character and dialog. I went into this movie with very unrealistically high expectations. So when I saw this movie, I was very worried but excited. <br><br>All the cast from the previous Avengers movie all reprise their roles. Robert Downey Juinor was amazing as Ironman. Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth were both great as Captain America and the mighty Thor. Scarlett Johanson was brilliant as Black Widow and was even more bad-ass in this movie, than any of her other films. Her role was substantially bigger this time around. This can also be said about Hawkeye, who's role was way bigger in this movie. In fact, Hawkeye even has some of the best lines and the best action sequences. Mark ruffilo was once again amazing as Hulk and Bruce Banner. The one character that stole the show, would be James Spader. He embodies an evil AI robot perfectly. He can be really calm and yet menacing and sometimes he can be full of rage and anger. Aron Taylor Johnson and Elisibeth Olsin are also a great new edition to the marvel universe. The scarlet Witch character has a big part in the film also.<br><br>The action has been dialed up and the set pieces are bigger and better. The cgi can seem a little off at times, but other than that, it looks fantastic.<br><br>The movie also spends time on the relationships and past of some characters, which leads to some great character moments. This is much more emotional, than the first movie. I would defiantly say that this movie is better than the first Avengers Movie!",14 April 2015
18,Mindless drivel,kbpatriot70,"Well, the superhero movies have sucked their last dollar out of me. I don't like watching movies just to see things blown up. The writers and director are so much into showing off their destructive action sequences that they didn't pause to consider whether soneone would actually give an F. Superthin plot. The occasional quip grom Ultron or an Avenger gets old quick with nothing else to support it. We're clearly dealing with high school humor here. I really like the scene where the earth is caving in, thousands of people obviously meeting gruesome deaths, and yet a few Avengers take the time to save one woman in a falling vehicle...NOT.",15 May 2015
19,A lackluster superhero flick,OllieSuave-007,"This movie takes a long time to gain any steam, with a lot of all talk and no action in the first half of the movie. There is also little suspense and intrigue - just the superheroes pondering and conjuring their next mission, with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner creating a project called Ultron to act as a peacekeeping program serving as the movie's backdrop.<br><br>The Ultron project goes horribly wrong and the machine takes a mind of its own, threatening to rid the world of humans in attempts to ""save the world"" - something we've heard before.<br><br>We get to see action slowly trickle in during the second half of the movie slowly - lots of crazy CGI action during the rumbling climax. This film's plot sets the story for the next film, Captain America: Civil War, in motion. However, I thought this film overall lacked the entertainment value due to its extremely slow plot and lackluster story.<br><br>Grade D",25 July 2016
20,"Explosive and Visually Extravagant, Yet Also Profound",prospectus_capricornium,"Given how teeming with multiple awkwardly-diverse characters the AVENGERS franchise is, you can imagine how difficult and mentally-exhausting it is to gather all these uniquely vivid plot lines, with all their interspersing expositories and asides, and still be able to form one coherent and fluidly-constructed narrative. The first Avengers movie proved itself able to carry the weight of such challenge, and came out successful in delivering one the most poignant superheroic tales ever told. This year, AGE of ULTRON blasts into cinemas carrying the load of mammoth anticipation. While it is expected to perform better¬óif not as well as the previous release¬óit will not be totally surprising, and will still be forgivable, if it falls just a feet beneath the staggering anticipation. Well, you can thank Joss Whedon for helming this projec. This movie soars past expectations.<br><br>In AGE OF ULTRON, as the characters further expand, new names join the team, proving how much more difficult it must be for the screenwriters to still cling to their material's soundness, and make that further engaging and compelling. Nevertheless, Whedon and his prolific team of scriptwriters, come out triumphant over these apparent hurdles, managing again to weave all the heroes' divergent story lines and confine them together into one solid plot. Whedon effectively mines the capacities of these individuals and turns them into the very foundation of his epic superhero saga.<br><br>Robert Downey's Iron Man/Tony Stark remains as a formidable figurehead in spite of his ever cynical and highly confident posture, while Chris Evans provides a dependable alternative with Captain America's leadership. There's an implicit undertone playing beneath the trajectory of these two leaders' relationship, and that might serve as an indirect catalyst to what is set to unfold in Captain America: Civil War. Chris Hemsworth's guileless 'Thor' is ever militant, yet innocent. This movie also draws more of the previous installment's less-utilized characters, into the scopes of its spotlight. Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, enjoys his expanded character whose interaction with other avengers, has immensely improved, and he also has some of the best jaw-dropping action sequences here. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk still smashes, he's as diffident as he is dangerous, and yet still charmingly funny. Scarlett Johanson's character, Black Widow, has been treated with bigger attention, and her presence is never less if not as strong as her male counterparts. To forget the newcomers, Taylor Johnson's Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch, is totally unfair too, as these two cemented their fiery presence right at the very first battle sequence of the movie. Same can be said with Paul Bettany's Vision, whose mysterious power might be the very weapon that could propel the Avengers to winning their battle against their biggest enemy: ULTRON. James Spader's voice strikes as the perfect embodiment of the indomitable android ULTRON who is hellbent to rendering the planet to extinction. Spader has the utmost command of the character and has fueled it with utter rage and bitterness, and calm and ease when needed. You're not going to forget Sam Jackson's Nick Fury too, and the rest of his team, including Falcon. He's as effectively leading his team here when he is needed to be as he was, the first time Avengers were called to assemble. It features Andy Serkis' entry to the franchise too, and while it's brief, he manages to established a commanding presence in the movie. The film grants everybody the right amount of exposure to shine, letting both their inner fragilities and physical prowess speak volumes for who they are. Their imperfections claim pivotal share in their greatest undertaking¬ówinning their very own internal battles so they could emerge able to save the world from the wrecking weights of annihilation.<br><br>Straightaway at the beginning, Age of Ultron throws our heroes into roaring action, drawing us immediately into a surfeit of explosive and visually-omnipotent action extravaganzas that allow every smashing, pounding, flash of beams, flight, and basically everything, assume near-impossible forms of eye-squashing spectacles. It is when all these heroes engage together in combat against their enemies, that the movie subjugates all those hungry eyes, and grasps total domination over the audience's attention, letting the awestruck reception hum along the visual drama as it extends its reach beyond imagination. It is also when all the death-defying sequences and breathtakingly choreographed action set-pieces, spin out to full throttle, that the underlying cause why this band of superheroes fight with their lives, becomes blindingly evident¬óhumanity. This is what had put them into this circle, in the first place, and it's what they are now aiming to preserve even when they have to wrestle with death. Whedon has never deprived these characters of humanity, making each of them similar, albeit their much readily-perceived differences. This summons affection for these characters, which right away the film gathers, whenever it puts the narrative's soul into the spotlight.<br><br>AVENGERS: Age of Ultron is without fault, but too few and little that they're not even worth-noting. To be able to gather all these radical personas and bring their different worlds into one concrete universe, is already a colossal feat. Whedon proves to be capable of pushing the limits of the movie's accomplishments past that milestone, and the result is never less than monumental. The whole experience imparts an overwhelming sense of satisfaction, yet it also makes the audience hunger for more. Well, the movie lays ground-works and unleashes potential backdoors for the franchise's next chapters, and that makes everything that follows something to look forward to.<br><br>AVENGERS: AGE of ULTRON is visually enthralling as it is emotionally profound, a cinematic achievement soaring above the previously reached heights in the ever expanding universe of superhero movies. 9/10",22 April 2015
21,"Solid, if slightly flawed, entry in the Marvel Universe",drew_atreides,"...Phase 2 of the Marvel movies had been batting .500 for me.

I liked the horror-movie tropes tied to Scarlet Witch (she is a Witch afterall!) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver had a lot of personality.<br><br>The action, of course, was great.

The Avengers: Age of Ultron is the best superhero film in my opinion because of the huge surprises in the movie and the incredibly thrilling storyline from the comics, the directors of the movie did change the storyline a bit though, it's not like a copy and paste storyline from the comic book.

24,Disappointed because the name set up expectations,et-89,"I tend to enjoy the Marvel movies and animated movies / TV series when I can catch them. Unfortunately I caught Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow on TV once, and that, coupled with the name Age of Ultron, led me to expect something like that animated movie or Days of Future Past: that Ultron takes over and there's a desperate struggle to overthrow him. One early trailer I saw also seemed to enforce such an impression.<br><br>Unfortunately Ultron turned out to be a rather impotent villain. He's full of potential danger, but doesn't manage to realise any of that potential. The trailers made the movie look like the threat is a lot bigger than it was. Pretty much every danger in this movie is short term and thwarted without too much problem. I kept waiting for something truly dramatic to happen, but it never did. There's no Age of Ultron in this movie, not even a glimpse of it, and for me that was disappointing enough that I didn't enjoy the movie much.<br><br>There's decent action, drama and humour, it's not a badly made movie, but the villain is weak, and even the ultimate danger, the death of the human race, is less dramatic than potential subjugation, which is what most villains go for.",20 January 2016

27,Truly a MARVEL of a movie!,utopian-92350,"****NO Spoilers**** I went to see the latest installment in the Marvel canon of films last night at one of the UK midnight screenings.<br><br>My expectations for this movie were sky-high, but not only were those expectations met - they were blown clean out of the water.<br><br>Is it as good as 'The Avengers', arguably the best comic book movie of all time? It is...and it is so much more. It may be lacking the magic of seeing these characters assemble for the first time, but it makes up for that with many goose bump moments throughout.<br><br>Does the movie have flaws? Of course it does - how could a movie with this scale and this ambition possibly not have any? These flaws, however, are so minor (a couple of plot contrivances, some shaky character accents) compared to what Joss Whedon was able to achieve that anyone who focuses on them extensively is just nitpicking for the sake of it.<br><br>This is as close to perfect as a summer blockbuster movie can possibly get. You get a bit of everything: character development, great individual character moments, a rich and interesting plot with a great villain and the usual rich dollops of Whedon humor (yes, the movie is 'darker' than the first, but it is almost as funny even so). How he manages to balance so many screen presences so magnificently is beyond me, it comes off as an almost completely effortless master class in rapid-fire plotting and dialog. As in the first Avengers movie, everyone gets their moment in the spotlight and the characters that may have come up a little short in the first installment, most notably Hawkeye and Black Widow, get to shine especially in this iteration.<br><br>The action sequences are breathtakingly, mind-bogglingly well choreographed and directed and there are numerous shots that seem to leap from a comic book page. There are several moments where - if you feel any connection to these characters and their rich comic book history at all - you will feel the urge to leap from your seat and pump your fist in the air. There is so much to care for, so much to cheer for, so much to marvel at it is quite literally too much to fully appreciate in one viewing. <br><br>...and this is where we get to what (some) of the critics are griping about: Yes, the movie is long (personally, I could have sat there watching this spectacle another hour). Yes, it is crammed with content (characters, plot lines, setups for future movies) in every single frame - but never to an extent that you are taken out of the narrative. This movie will stand up fantastically to repeated viewings because there is so much to enjoy, so much to soak up and there are so many great moments to savor.<br><br>Finally, the stand-out character of this movie is a new arrival: The Vision. Paul Bettany delivers a perfectly balanced performance in this role and when his character soars through the air, golden cape and all, it is a joy to behold. This is truly a comic book come to life...and I can't wait to see where the story takes us next.<br><br>Boy, do the Russo brothers have a mountain to climb for the upcoming 'Infinity War' saga - this will be a tough act to follow.",23 April 2015

Well, Joss Whedon is officially a genius and the talent of this cast was evident in every scene. They all hit it out of the park. Yes, I just love Avengers Age of Ultron. This movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on absolutely all of your emotions. The last time I enjoyed a movie this much was the last time these characters assembled. Again, they managed to deliver a remarkable cool factor. What makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different. Winter Soldier delivered conspiracy thrills. The Iron Man trilogy factored in Tony Stark's complete dramatic arc, character flaws and all. The Dark World was pure sci-fi fantasy. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that resulted is an extra special treat. <br><br>It all works so well and is grounded enough to carry the story and the audience through an unbelievable ride. In fact, it doesn't just fit, it's an exciting symphony and that dichotomy and difference in characters and how they interact are what makes this movie truly great. It's why Avengers stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, Fast/Furious, and even Star Wars or Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers all angles and even multiple genres all by itself. It delivers depth of character with its fun and amazing action sequences. There's a reason why these movies make as much money as they do. They deliver a lot of everything and do so at a high quality.<br><br>Right from the beginning of the movie, where we get the all in one tracking shot, through the epic final globe smashing conclusion, everything is on go and everything delivers superb intensity and spectacle.

But first something positive.<br><br>The action is awesome, the effects are, for the most part, pretty good, there where two or free good jokes in it and it is decently directed. I also like the fact that they used some parts from the score of the first movie. There was also a cool scene where Ultron talks to the twins and they tell him what happened to their family. Ultron talked neutral to them and not like someone who is about to wipe out humanity. Finally, though i start to notice that in a lot of Films recently, i want to point out the very first scene which is a Really good action scene and it is done in one shot.

Also, the new characters are just not interesting. It doesn't help, that the performances are really not that good either. They're OK, but nothing great and all of these actors can do so much better.<br><br>The villain is just bad. Aside from his clich√©d motivation, which i don't mind that much but i want to point it out anyway, he is just not intimidating. And the stupid attempt to make him funny by having him have goofy reactions doesn't help.<br><br>The dialog between the characters is 90% one liners, especially during the intense action. With this cheap attempt to constantly be funny i cant get sucked in because i permanently have the impression, that none of the characters takes anything seriously. And the jokes where almost never funny.<br><br>There is a huge load of plot conveniences in this movie and a ton of things that are never explained.<br><br>That's about it. For the rest, i would enter spoiler territory and then i would write forever. <br><br>Overall this film is sadly average and gives us nothing new. But i think the main problem with this can be clearly detected with the help of a certain scene. Don't worry, i won't spoil anything but in this scene a character has a vision about the infinity gems and he only sees the ones that have appeared in a movie so far. The images can't come from his own mind because he has no idea about the orb from guardians, at least it's not explained that he might know something about it, which means something different showed him the gems. And whatever made him see the stones, it was somehow aware of the fact that the Last two gems haven't appeared in a Movie so far because there is absolutely no reason for not at least showing them. Which leads me to the conclusion, that those images where not for the character in the film, but for the audience.<br><br>Instead of writing a really clever movie we should just through in a bunch of one liners and some images that the audience is going to jerk off to. Why make a peace of art when we can make lots of money?",23 April 2015
32,"Everything a superhero movie has, but not what it needs",Erin Parker,"I am a Marvel ""fangirl"". I loved seeing Avengers (the first one) and have anticipated this movie for quite some time. Unfortunately it was nothing special. It fitted in with the ""HOW TO WRITE A SUPERHERO MOVIE"" checkbook that one may give out in a creative writing class for 8 year old but (because of that) it was the most mediocre movie I have seen in a long time. Here are a few reasons why, written in list form for easy reading!<br><br>1) Bland Villain Tom Hiddleston as Loki was amazing. ""Ultron"", however, was not. Yes he had the whole I-will-destroy-the-human-race-and- triumph ideology but it was all without substance to back it up. Why did he hate the avengers so much? That was never fully explained. Nor were his motives to wipe out the human race. I love villains as characters. I find them the most interesting characters due to their often- troubled backstories and how they managed to reach the point of 'evil' but Ultron lacked any of that.<br><br>2) Character Development??? What happened to Captain America with his struggles in defining his moral compass in The Winter Soldier? All of a sudden he is back to being the clean-cut good guy. That's great, consistent character development guys! I've also always thought him and Natasha have been flirty in previous movies but in this a romance between her and Bruce appeared from nowhere! I wouldn't have minded if it was a slow process of them casting coy looks and flirty remarks in this movie and perhaps in the 3rd movie the romance formation but instead it was all forced on the audience too much too soon. The same for Hawkeyes family - which, in turn, I also didn't care for at all. And if Hawkeye is so secretive about his family why does he carry a picture of them with him all the time? Surely if he is murdered the picture will be found and his private life exposed.<br><br>All I can say is - the movie was too focused on action. This set the characters back any decent character development. Im also annoyed that no one was struggling at the cold air/lack of oxygen when the city was floating miles above ground but hey, its sci-fi right?",10 May 2015
33,a train wreck,ertan-12152,"this movie was honestly a train wreck it started too slow, the ending was rushed so many lines delivered were unneeded and seemed forced in an attempt to seem witty when actually the result was making them look like a generic stereotype 'witty character' and character development?<br><br>OK they scratched the surface on a few characters but not enough to make me feel anything when something bad happens to them. i get there's a lot of characters in the avengers but when you kill a character its supposed to actually make me feel something, instead it just seemed like a terrible attempt at shock value. another thing on character development.... has Joss Whedon seen Captain America 2? or like. looked at a comic? maybe read the wiki? he ignored the development of Steve and Natasha completely, fitting them back into the stereotypes he'd created in the first movie that language line? Steve got in fights in back alleys probably every day. his best friend was Bucky Barnes. he was a part of the HOWLING COMMANDOS! you're telling me he tells people off when they swear? i think you'll fond they probably tell him off for being TOO foul with his language. also, the entirety of the previous film he was filled with angst over Bucky but what he gets mentioned offhandedly and thats it? not even a brief appearance in the fear-flashback? and Natasha. such a brilliant witty character in cap 2, got squashed down into the role of the belle to Bruce's beast. don't get me started on the choice of going with 616 back story for Hawkeye. i mean really guys? really? i could go on but even thinking of the film puts me in a bad mood. i mean i kind of had low expectations going into the film but Christ even they were too high.",23 April 2015
34,Avengers assemble once again!!!,c_razz_y,"Let's just get straight to point here, Avengers Age of Ultron is the best marvel movie to date. You can make a strong argument for it being the best superhero movie of all time. Yes it's really that good. <br><br>The plot line was very intriguing. It was far from the clich√© superhero story. The script was funny and very witty. Joss Whedon did a wonderful job, it's a shame that he won't be directing the next 2 avengers films. The only upside is that he will be still there as a producer for phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This story really sets up phase 3 and one of the most anticipated movies of 2016, Captain America: Civil War. My one regret in terms of the story is that it could be slightly longer, even though the entire film ran smoothly. I would have still liked to see more of the movie, I guess we will have to wait for the DVD release to see some extra scenes. <br><br>All the actors, unsurprisingly, played their roles superbly. Robert Downey jr again played the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, which we all love. This performance just adds to the argument that he is Iron Man. Chris Evan always brings a sense of honesty and heart to the role of Captain America. Scarlet Johansson again showed us that a male isn't the only one who can be a badass that young boys look up to. Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Samuel L Jackson, Jeremy Renner, Cobie Smulders, Don Cheadle and Anthony Mackie all reprised their roles wonderfully and each one of them added an extra dimension to their character. The newcomers Thomas Kretschmann, Andy Serkis, Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson were all great additions to the already extremely talented and lively cast. The newcomer that really gave the strongest performance was clearly James Spader. His intimidating robotic voice really brought the character to life and added sense of realism, in an otherwise unbelievable character. He brought our future fears (from terminator) of an AI trying to wipe out humanity. Marvel are not known for their memorable super villains, in fact they're known for the opposite of this, but this villain is up there with Loki, Ultron is one of the more terrifying and surprisingly relatable/understandable villains in the MCU. However Paul Bettany's performance as the vision stole the show. He took the spotlight for every scene that he was in and I can't wait to see him again. The cast really gel well as a unit and you'll be thinking that these actors grew up with each other, after you've seen the movie. The chemistry between everyone holds the film together. <br><br>The action in the movie, let's just make this quick, was mind blowing. For anyone who's seen the trailers, you will already know that the action shown was amazing. For any of you that think that they've showed too much or every action piece, from the movie, in the trailers, you couldn't be more wrong. When you watch the movie you'll notice that the action scenes are orchestrated beautifully and that every character has upped their game since the last time we saw them on screen, especially Captain America. This is a big budget movie and this is clearly shown in the stunts and the action sequences. The movie was shot all over the world this time and that helps to show that these group of people don't just fight for one nation but the world. The locations were beautiful and i will always prefer a real natural set over a green screen. <br><br>This movie was a fantastic treat to watch and it's really a shame that this movie wasn't longer, so that we could all enjoy it for 20-30 minutes more. I had high expectations coming into the theatre and when I left, I was more than satisfied. This movie will be enjoyed by people of all ages, it's got cool action for the kids and the plot is more than interesting enough to hold the attention of the adults. This movie delivers on all levels and can be considered as one of the best, if not the best movie of all time. It's clearly the best movie in the past few years. P.S. Stay for after the movie ends (mid-credits) for a treat for phase 3. <br><br>I will be uploading a video review to this movie soon. Please subscribe to my channel and watch the videos already posted. Thank you for your time! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQzQVmzrHi_IzaxQ5jH9Cig/videos Uploaded the review now!! Please watch!!<br><br>http://youtu.be/80HlwBIDBJg",18 April 2015
35,Even with high expectations it doesn't even disappoint!,Joejoesan,"Tony Stark wants to invent something that benefits mankind but instead turns out to be the one responsible for the creation of this dangerous self thinking robot, Ultron. The Avengers must assemble once again to fight this menace that wants to kill all the humans on this planet. But Ultron is powerful and the way he is presented makes you wonder how our heroes can defeat him. Just you wait and see...<br><br>What I liked best about Age of Ultron was the fact that all our favorite heroes get equal screen time to show of what they can do. Although the action scenes are great (Iron Man in the Hulkbuster versus Hulk!) the thing that really makes this movie work is the interaction between all the people involved. Stark and Banner, Banner and Black Widow, Hawkeye and Black Widow, Thor and Captain America... like in real life you can see with whom each of them get along best. It's also nice to see that Hawkeye gets a lot of screen time. He even gets the most interesting background story of the bunch. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch make a great addition to the team (sort of) and there are a lot more cameos in the movie (although I don't think anybody spotted Lou Ferrigno!).<br><br>The movie runs about two and a half hours and that's pretty long. It could have been a little bit shorter, but overall I didn't mind. With great action scenes (pay attention to the opening action sequence in which he introduces the Avengers in one mighty shot!), nice humor, a lot of cameos and a satisfying finale writer/director Joss Whedon has everything under control and that pays of.<br><br>This year (2015) The Avengers Age of Ultron will shatter all box office records and that will be a fitting reward for giving most Marvel fans and 'normal' moviegoers this big treat. Even Pixar slipped (with Cars 2 and Brave) so everybody's waiting for Marvel to produce a real stinker.

36,Disappointing,Miguel Neto,"Disappointing, it summarizes Avengers: Age of Ultron, the film is not bad, it's cool just cool, it is frustrating because all the world expected to be better than the first Avengers Ultron which is one of the best villains of the Marvel Comics he is simply poorly executed in this movie, really the film beginning excited about the action scenes, the effects are excellent, the CGI movie is hardly exaggerated, Mercury and another character very badly used, as the scarlet witch for a future in this universe Marvel, the film is unnecessary scenes, the jokes are always in the wrong time it breaks the film's climax, and the end where the Hulk flees the ship hope to explain in the Civil War film, now the worst thing in the movie, Hawkeye it has more space than owed it gets to be ridiculous, he can tip the witch and the mercury that was really ridiculous, the final scene of the movie was good most not enough to thrill, Avengers: Age of Ultron is not even bad, far from it, more we expected so that was better than the first to disappoint.

37,"Action, action and action",thenopeman,"Spoiler free review.<br><br>I can't say the film didn't lack action because it didn't, every minute was filled with brilliant effects and amazing shots. An action packed adrenaline ride all through. However this said the film lacked story. At first the film was taking over from the first avengers, the story was good. But somewhere into the film the story fell apart with too much happening and without the solid story line it felt weak, with no real connections at all there was just fighting and action all over. I thought from what little story this film had to offer it was a lot more comic based than the previous one. The main villain in this film felt like a weakly based character, he had little to do with the story and was probably a contributing factor into it's downfall.<br><br>In conclusion I thought that the action, acting and effects are among the best, however the weak story left me with a far different feeling to the first. I thought although this film was great for a sequel it wasn't as good as the first. The film felt like it was meant to put a story across ready for the next film, which I hope will have a better story and live up to my expectations! However if for now you're looking for a great action film this is definitely a great one to watch, even though the story was weak and lacked that edge it is still a great film and hopefully will make an even better trilogy!",30 April 2015
38,"Messier, for sure, but still plenty of ""Avengers"" fun",Movie_Muse_Reviews,"The task of bringing together Earth's mightiest heroes took Joss Whedon into uncharted territory with 2012's ""The Avengers,"" and, despite the weight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on his shoulders, the results were staggeringly entertaining. The task of making a sequel to that ground-breaking, monumental event film, however, and being expected to deliver on par or better results, is an entirely different beast.<br><br>""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" was definitely built on the bullet point takeaways of ""The Avengers,"" which are: Make time and space for wit, banter and humor for the sake of humor to prevent the film from taking itself too seriously; give each character a story arch and independent moments; choreography clever action sequences with well-timed glory shots. These components are in full force in ""Ultron"" and make enjoying the blockbuster as easy as shoving a lollipop in your mouth.<br><br>Yet ""Ultron"" is infinitely more complex than its predecessor. The number of heroes featured barely fits into a single action figure play case, meaning more subplots and back story, in addition to creating an arch of the creation and life of Ultron itself. With a plot that takes the Avengers from the eastern European country of ""Sokovia"" to New York to the African nation of ""Wakanda"" to Seoul, South Korea to Sokovia again, much of ""Age of Ultron"" is a non-stop blur.<br><br>The film opens with the Avengers leading an assault on a secret HYDRA facility where they have located the staff that Loki used to lead the Chitauri invasion in ""The Avengers."" When they secure it and bring it back to New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discover that its power source contains a blueprint for artificial intelligence, which would allow Stark to proceed with his Ultron project, an initiative to create peace-keeping robots that could defend the world in place of the Avengers should another alien invasion occur. When Ultron (voiced by James Spader) becomes conscious, however, he interprets his peace-keeping instructions as an imperative to wipe out humankind.<br><br>Added to the mix are the Maximoff twins, Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) ¬ñ also known as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch ¬ñ who decide to serve Ultron, with the latter using her powers to give each of the Avengers dangerous visions that could tear them apart.<br><br>The fight scenes and action sequences are in such abundance in ""Ultron"" that it's impossible to remember them all, and the ones that are most distinct, such as Iron Man chasing down and taming a rampant Hulk using his Hulkbuster armor, are ancillary to the narrative of finding what Ultron is up to and stopping it. In other words ¬ñ it's all for show. The creativity of the fight choreography also gets lost in the whirlwind of action. Captain America (Chris Evans) probably does 12 different awesome things with his shield, but they happen so fast you'll be hard pressed to recall any one of them in detail. Really clever sequences are only as fun as the build-up and payoff and those pieces are given no time to breathe.<br><br>Whedon does allow for pauses in the chaos, such as the swanky Avengers Tower party featuring the film's best scene, when each Avenger tries his hand at lifting Thor's hammer, or a quiet retreat to an unexpected safe house in the countryside, but it's simply a trade- off: instead of busy action sequences, we get character relationship dynamics and back story.<br><br>""Ultron"" is inundating, to be frank, but for the everything-but-the-sink mentality, it's carried by its sense of humor and a cast whose members have each proved themselves time and again to be magnetic both on their own and as part of this team. Some of the novelty has worn off, but seeing all these characters together remains a treat that even the most convoluted of stories cannot entirely dismantle. Marvel Studios truly proves with ""Ultron"" the credibility that it has built with fans, to the point that even when it gets a little ambitious and mettles a bit more (you can easily see Whedon at odds with them in this final cut), its reputation remains intact and the fans placated.<br><br>As ""Phase III"" begins, adding even more characters to Marvel's cinematic universe (and even sliding Spider-Man into the mix) en route to the two-part ""Avengers: Infinity War"" slated for 2018 and 2019, it will be interesting to see if Marvel Studios barrels along into more unwieldy but delicious chaos, or reins it in a touch.

40,Avengers re-assemble.,Corey James,"Avengers:Age of Ultron my just be the best film of 2015 it started off great with a lot of action. Why I think this is the best superhero sequel ever.<br><br>Okay first thing this film is action packed there is a lot more action than the first one so basically the story is still there but the action literally takes over.<br><br>Second thing is the Hulkbuster now you may be thinking is it as awesome as it looks on the trailer the answer is yes...it is a lot more awesome than on the trailer and plus that action sequence goes on for quite some time. <br><br>Third thing Ultron now Ultron may have been toned down to how he was in the comics but in this film he is still as malevolent and vicious as ever but with limits obviously with it being PG-13. Ultron in this film is played by James Spader and he doesn't lack at all you can still tell that Ultron is one of the most dangerous villain The Avengers have ever faced. <br><br>Fourth thing the plot the film this time doesn't rely too much on it's story it's more the action that builds the film obviously there is still a story and it's a very good one there are some bits where the film slows down for it but that is really what a superhero film is about especially generation, when we rely on origin stories in superhero films. <br><br>Fifth and final thing does it feel like too much Disney? the answer for that question is no it doesn't see the first film really felt like it was too much Disney but in this film it's a lot darker than the first film because you see some of The Avengers literally feel pain. Plus the first film was more of a full on introduction to The Avengers and what they do. This film is far from Disney now and well in that case that's better I did love the first film too. <br><br>If you are a superhero fan and loved Ultron in the comics then you are going to love him even more in the film. This film was worth every penny and I think that well mainly superhero fans should go see this movie don't wait for it to come out on DVD just go see because it is amazing and is far better than the first. 8/10 must see superhero film.",24 April 2015

So let me start off by saying that action movies are not my absolute favorite genre in the world, I do enjoy action but I dislike when a scene of action goes on so long that you forget exactly why they are fighting in the first place. Well. Avengers Return of Ultron was action packed AWESOMENESS. They knew exactly how to break up all the action with GENUINE humor (not groan worthy puns. I'm looking at you Furious Seven) and class. This movie is the whole package for EVERYONE. You have action, romance and humor. This is SURPRISINGLY better than the first one! The story line that they put together was genius and the cinematography of the final battle scene sincerely took my breath away. This is a must see for fans of action, the Avengers, but also movies!

Ignore the narrative because the opening involves lots of stunts , ramping and explosions with the occasional one liner thrown in . You want action you've got it . You want intelligent , stimulating storytelling ? Go and read a book . I can understand what the producers are pandering to but I found this pre-title sequence rather uninvolving and the rest of the film continues in the same way <br><br>One thing the film does try and do is merge high concept action with character driven moments . On paper it does have a relatively good cast and it'd be a pity to waste it on overblown action but it's not really an actors type of film and while the production team deserves some credit for trying to concentrate on character but it's not developed enough to be entirely successful and comes across as rather shallow <br><br>Despite this short review I'm big enough to stick up my hand and say this movie isn't produced for grumpy , middle aged men like myself , it's produced for younger people who can't get enough superhero movies and for this market the prospective audience will probably love it so much so that that'll be a contender for biggest grossing film of 2015 and we'll be getting more Marvel movies for the foreseeable future",28 April 2015

Either this world is about to face the apocalypse of morons or ""taste"" became something to chose in the McDonald's menu...<br><br>Nevertheless, this movie is not crap, you might watch it if you prefer a story full of plot holes big enough to hide at least a group of a hundred Hulks in them and characters as pale and static as the Terracotta Army in the famous Chinese grave. Besides, this film has SFX. And it is a hell of a thunderstorm of SFX... I stopped counting after the 10th SFX company listed in the credits. So if your age starts with a 1 and has no more than another digit to follow, you might be entertained and amused about all these effects, virtually in every single scene.

The visuals are marvelous &amp; the action-sequences are expertly choreographed. But, the narrative is stilted &amp; soulless. Also, the pace is dreadfully slow in the first-hour. I was throughly bored in this hour, almost in disbelief if this one is actually a marvel movie.<br><br>Joss Whedon's Screenplay is a downer. He made a terrific film previously, but this time around, he has faltered. The Writing Material surrenders to graphics &amp; makes very less use of its own strength. Whedon's Direction, on the other-hand, is fair. Cinematography is alright. Editing is loose, the film runs for a long 142-minutes! <br><br>The Avengers, however, do well. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, donning the part for the fifth time, hasn't lost his charm. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, is excellent here, while Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, looks tired. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, has his moments. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, is passable. Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, is a pleasant surprise here. He actually gets scope to perform this time &amp; he does. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver &amp; Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, add freshness in the proceedings. James Spader as Ultron, is the biggest letdown. He gives the villain a hammy turn, which by no means, works. <br><br>On the whole, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is very high on hype, but low on substance.",24 April 2015
50,Amazing Movie...But of course the majority doesn't see that...,Nate Collins,"One thing people keep saying is the problem in the avenger films and in the MCU(marvel Cinematic universe) is that every film is only a stepping stone, like its leading up to something. but is juts putting the story off. whats the problem here? Yes every film is leading to the big ending which Im certain will be the infinity war. So yes every movie plays an intricate part in leading up to that. But its called a Story. Thats how you build a story, especially a super awesome one like this. You don't just skip to the end. Its like people don't see what amazing film making is done here. There's never been so many movies that connect and every decision made affects another movie.Nobody complains about that with the hunger games or the harry potter series, but guess what its the same thing. Only much more difficult here since all of the big players get their own films.<br><br>Another complaint is hulk and the black widow's love relationship. I'll admit it threw me for a loop too. Didn't see that coming at all. But why is it so bad? I mean if you really think about it, we learn a little more about black widow each film shes in. And in this film we really learn that she did things in her past she isn't proud of. She feels like a monster inside. Who else on the team feels like a monster? and literally turns into one? The Hulk. It makes sense they have a connection. Hawkeye has his own family, and captain America and her really just don't click on that level, not to mention he seems as if he is still stuck on Peggy carter from his past. Somebody said the MCU seems to be very sexless? I'm not sure if you mean there isn't enough nudity or sexual content, but if that's the case, you are sadly mistaken. Its under Disney for starters and its based on children's comic books. Kids are definitely going to go see it. Or if you meant there isn't enough love stories, then you are also not paying attention and mistaken. Tony Stark/Pepper Potts. Thor/Jane.Captain America/Peggy Carter. Hawkeye now has a wife we see. The Hulk had a love story in his own movie and now with black widow. So to say the MCU is sexless, doesn't make sense. One thing I keep seeing from people is they don't understand how Ultron is basically alive and can talk. they say right in the film more than once. its artificial intelligence. That means he has ""the ability of a computer or other machine to perform those activities that are normally thought to require intelligence""Tony stark and Bruce banner uploaded him into there system and he takes over . The reason they did this was because tony stark wanted shield the world from invaders, like the first film. and then people said nobody blamed tony stark for this?!! were you watching at all!? Over and over again everybody was mad with him, captain America especially. Then Someone said they thought this would build up to a iron man vs. captain America civil war but then nothing it falls flat! seriously the next film after ant man is Captain America Civil War! Why are people mad Hawkeye has a family? He got screwed in most of the first film, he was just a pawn. In this film we get to see the real Hawkeye, and people are mad at this? Give the guy a break. He is a part of the avengers and doesn't get his own films, So why is it such a big deal he got some quality screen time, and it was a big plan to set him up for his death which we all thought was going to happen only to see quicksilver go. And someone said the movie is predictable?!That totally threw everybody for a loop. And they are saying it's random he has a family? He said He didn't want anybody to know. so why would you know about it if nobody did He fights bad guys all day, why would he be spreading around he has a wife and kids. Somebody said the beginning is pointless and makes no sense to the story line? Once again if you watched the last film before this one, which was the second Captain America the whole storyline was about Hydra taking over Shield, and destroying it. Hence why there is no shield in this movie until the end. In the start of this film they sort of wrap that storyline up, by taking the hydra base and getting the plans for Ultron to start this story. If every movie had the same story it would be boring, also the beginning set up the twins to be in this movie, since it was Strucker who experimented on them and gave them their abilities. So to say this opening seen wasn't important, is ludicrous because it was. I've heard people say the visions the witch gives the heroes is dumb, and they don't care about it. Well if you watched Thors' at all, its what all of these movies have been about, the infinity stones. And he is going to start figuring that out. We've seen 4 of the 6. which by the time infinity war comes around, all 6 will be revealed. and is what its all about. How can you say its not important? And its beyond me why you would say there are too many characters!? They get there own films for a reason. Because in these films, it about them as a team. There characters have been developed, and they still are but obviously it will be harder with more characters. But that's the whole fun in the avenger films. All of these awesome beings together. Every body is aloud there own opinion, I understand that, But the majority of things being said make absolutely no sense.",4 May 2015
51,Worthy of Thor's hammer!,glennmeerten06,"Even up to this day, I regret not seeing The Avengers in theaters when it came out! I'm in love with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Iron Man, Captain America and the Guardians of the Galaxy... Just writing down the titles gets me excited. The Avengers would be the culmination of all these epic superheroes! And by god it was! It was clever, it was fast, it was epic, it was funny, it was awesome! The Avengers set the bar at such a level, the curse of bad sequels was bound to pop up its nasty head. Well, with great pleasure, I can say it hasn't. Avengers: Age of Ultron (without ""The"" for some reason) is so much fun it's crazy. The action is quick, epic and on point. The teamwork is so awesome: just think about combining Cap's shield and Thor's hammer and let your imagination run wild. That's what the creators of AOU did with the action scenes: just let their creativity flow and use these amazing super abilities and just mix and mash them together to create some epic visuals. <br><br>The story is quite interesting: Tony Stark wants to create a robotic army of peacekeepers to take over from the Avengers and make them no longer needed. This backfires when his creation Ultron activates and his A.I. concludes that humanity's extinction is the only way to ensure peace on earth. It's interesting to see the cracks develop within the team. The twin who were teased at the end of The Winter Soldier come to the scene and start stirring up trouble. I was so happy to see Hawk Eye shine in the flick. In part one he was just a stool for the freaking awesome Loki for most of the film but now he gets so much more to do and he's just such a lovable character! <br><br>Visually, Age of Ultron is up to par with previous Marvel movies. It looks great, especially the climax of the movie is just a joy to watch. <br><br>I had some gripes with the film though. For starters I found it quite odd to see Iron Man just doing his thing when it wasn't explained how he came back from his retirement after Iron Man 3. I'm glad he's back but some info would be nice. Secondly there's a romance which feels out of place because it wasn't earned in previous movies. It kind of feels forced and out of the blue. <br><br>The music is epic and grand. The Avengers theme is back and it's awesome! <br><br>Summary: Fun and epic sequel with minor gripes.",4 May 2015
52,A great follow up; but two major problems,ultron77,"My first impression of Age of Ultron is that it's a great film. The action scenes are spectacularly done. The interactions between characters, except for a few, are wonderful. And, needless to say, we get a fantastic villain out of James Spader playing Ultron.<br><br>But there were two things I found wrong. The first is the beginning. While we were given this good prologue to explain the setup of the main story, it was followed up with yet more exposition to start the main story and lengthy party sequence with too many nameless extras (Stan Lee's cameo being the only exception) that dragged on. This is all before Ultron even begins to function, and we're already twenty to thirty minutes into the film.<br><br>The second is the romantic relationship between Hulk and Black Widow. Alright, I confess. I am a Steve Rogers/Natasha Romanoff fan. But this pairup was so badly mishandled. There is no leadup to it; it just comes out of nowhere. At least with Cap and Hawkeye, there was chemistry to found on.<br><br>Besides these two things however, I would go as far to say that this movie is so well done that it could practically be The Empire Strikes Back of Avengers movies. Instead of being focused on the action like the first Avengers film was, Age of Ultron focused more on the characters and their developments as they deal with the situations they are being put through, or putting themselves into in some cases. I won't say anymore as I will spoil the film if I do. Go to the cinema and see it for yourself.",29 April 2015
53,Another Marvel home run,Pandamonium360,"This movie is my most anticipated film of 2015 and it lived up to the hype. It is one of the best action films that has been released in the last 5 years and one of the best comedies in the last 3 years.<br><br>This movie is like Marvels Empire Strikes Back because it is a lot darker then the original movie with the Avenger not being torn apart on the outside by Ultron but being torn apart from the inside with fighting between the group.<br><br>This movie took some risks with adding in characters like Quicksilver, Scarlett Witch and Vision and they all fit in perfectly, I would even say that Aaron Taylor Johnson's Quicksilver was as good as Even Peters. They also had a good explanation of how Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch actually happened.<br><br>Now probably the strongest part of the movie Ultron he was an even better villain then Loki was in the original because not only does he have the ability to test the Avengers but he is also delivering some of the best one liners in the whole film. He also had some great philosophical views and you understood why he was doing what he was doing. Also James Spaders voice worked perfectly for this villain.<br><br>So if you haven't guessed by now I loved this film and I think that you should go see it know.",23 April 2015
54,Help Me Save Marvel,Mai_Mai123,"**Spoiler-Free**<br><br>Word among those in the know is that Joss Whedon butted heads with Marvel regarding this sequel's storyline. Whedon, a truly gifted writer and director, wanted the same heart and soul as the first Avengers; Marvel wanted to ""Michael Bay"" the film with over-the-top fight scenes and explosions, as well as overstuff it with new characters and interconnected story lines from other films. (And, yes, ""Michael Bay"" is a verb for mind-numbing, plot-less, soul-sucking codswallop.) In context, Age of Ultron is actually enjoyable in that Whedon DOES manage to insert some soul into the film ¬ñ a feat that would have been nearly impossible in less capable hands. With that said, I would give the film a 6.0 or so.<br><br>Apparently, Marvel is planning to continue the trend of overstuffed, interconnected story lines. Director Edgar Wright left Ant-Man last year amid similar complaints. This is concerning because based on the sheer number of superhero trailers I saw before Age of Ultron started, Marvel's omnipresence will soon know no bounds ¬ñ but Marvel fans want quality, not quantity. Please don't confuse us with Transformer enthusiasts. Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier were unexpected gems. Last I checked, their box-office intakes weren't too shabby either. More of that please.",3 May 2015
55,Same old same old,geoced,"I could write a lengthy review about how dull this movie is, how the fact that it is so overcrowded with minor characters that none of the Avengers gets a proper treatment, how thin and ridiculous the script is, how bad the dialogs and jokes are, but in the end it wouldn't make a difference, because no matter how bad this umpteenth Marvel movie is, people will still see it, if only for the special effects. Marvel's universe is an endless money making machine so they will continue shoving their mediocre movies down our throats as long as they keep earning billions from it! To me, this movie could be summed up in 3 letters : SOB - same old bullshit. 5/10",7 August 2015
56,"He's fast, she's weird.....",FlashCallahan,"We find the team dealing with a threat of their own making..... a sentient robot called Ultron, who was originally designed as a peacekeeping program. Since Loki was captured, the team have been working to take down various cells of a secret society of villains known as HYDRA. <br><br>Their aim to make the world a better, safer place inspires Tony Stark to create Ultron, in order to respond to additional threats that the Avengers aren't able to handle. <br><br>Ultron, unfortunately, takes this directive way too seriously and believes that world peace can only be achieved by exterminating humanity, and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish this goal. <br><br>The battle between the Avengers and Ultron is further complicated by the appearance of superpowered twin Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch, who ally themselves with the homicidal android........<br><br>It was always going to be a tough call to match the first Avengers movie, which, in all fairness, was a monumental cinematic experience, but here, it appears that Whedon knew he couldn't match it, realise the film would make bucketloads anyway, and just hasn't bothered with many of the characters.<br><br>Oh yes, they have all the same screen time, but it appears that the heroes with their own separate franchises, have been sidelined in order for the humanistic side of the film to work, and in turn, it achieves it somewhat, but there is too much exposition that bloats the movie, and makes it, at times, an almost unbearable ordeal, which takes some doing, considering the wealth of characters in the film.<br><br>But the real problem with the film is its lack of urgency, and here Whedon isn't to blame, it's Disney/Marvel being greedy and boasting about the next phase of Marvel movies,so we know who is safe, so Ultrons mission seems a little too futile.<br><br>Where the humour in the first film was refreshing and went with the characters psyche, here it suffers the same as Thor: The Dark World Did, just too forced and unbelievable. Gone is Starks Sarcasm, Cap's future fear, and the general banter.<br><br>But it's still spectacular in places, the Hulkbuster Vs. Hulk battle is the highlight, bonkers and very funny, Spader channels Downey Jr. As Ultron, Frankensteins Monster to Starks Victor, and he is a perfect choice.<br><br>But the highlight of the film is Remmer, he really outshines the rest of the cast, the. It's human character in the film, and it's genuinely touching when he's with his family,showing a very vulnerable side to the Avengers.<br><br>Olsen is the best out of the newcomers, Johnson is okay, but his 'I bet you didn't see that coming' grates toward the end.<br><br>So all in all, it's a crushing disappointment for such an impressive franchise, major characters are sidelined, Jackson shows up like Schwarzennegar in the avengers, and friends pop up for no good reason from other Marvel movies.<br><br>It feels like one long build up for Civil War, which does sound impressive.<br><br>But then again this sounded wonderful.<br><br>Meh-vengers, if you would.....",25 April 2015
57,What a disappointment!,Michael Cesar,"I really expected more of this movie after Captain America: Winter Soldier able to balance drama, action and humor in the same movie, I thought it would not make old mistakes. But it was not what I saw. The biggest mistakes of Avengers 2: Humor exaggerated, forced romance between Banner and Natasha, ridiculous death of Quicksilver, HORROSOSO villain who does not boot fear anyone, and many other bad things, Hawk type in the movie just to make pose, show family Hawkeye ... After this bad film, I am disappointed with Marvel and with low expectations pros upcoming releases. I, who am more a fan of Marvel than DC, I'm beginning to think that DC will dominate cinemas",18 May 2015
58,Another Monumental Marvel Movie!,rannynm,"The Avengers assemble once again go up against a new corrupt, A.I. Ultron (James Spader). As the troupe pursue their mission, we're given a deeper understanding of our favorite super heroes. <br><br>There are not enough words in the world to express how happy I am. As a Marvel fan, this film showcases some of my favorite comic book characters together in one plot line in a bigger and better way. When you are dealing with a sequel, as a filmmaker, you're pretty much trying to top yourself. Thankfully, the filmmakers have out done themselves here. We're given a superior conflict, more characters and action beyond epic proportions. <br><br>I love this movie not only because it's a phenomenal Marvel film, but also an outstanding film in general. A movie is supposed to grab the audience and transport them to a universe with characters that not only we look up to but also identify with. Marvel has successfully created this reality. Every time I see a Marvel logo on a movie poster I'm excited to be sent back, once again, into their universe. <br><br>Marvel is a genius entertainment company because they establish their characters in previous films. The Avengers are the protagonist. Every character is given their moment in the lime light but, they are not the main focus. They all share the screen and have their own personal conflict, yet they respond as team. That is not to say that there is no character development, there is. Former story lines help save time so that the writers can focus on perfecting the current story. This also leads to much stronger relationships between the characters. <br><br>For people who have no history with Marvel films, I suggest that you see some of the previous films that feature the Avengers. The reason is that you may miss a connection with the characters that can be resolved by watching previous films. Although you will enjoy the action and story even without seeing the previous films, the inside jokes and interactions between characters become funnier when you understand the past. <br><br>The action in this film is awesome! The word awesome is a very primitive word, but it explains everything. While I love to go to the movies and appreciate storytelling and 3 dimensional characters, there are times when I just want to see things go boom! Every Avenger, with his or her different abilities, works together and kicks butt. An example of this is when Thor hits Captain America's shield and causes a devastating explosion. You have to see it to believe it.<br><br>My favorite character is, Vision (Paul Bettany) an android created by Ultron. Bettany is originally the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark's (Robert Downey, Jr.) A.I. companion. Bettany uses his fantastic voice to create Vision. I was excited when I heard he was going to be a new addition to the Avengers team. Not only is the acting and personality spot on, but the costume design is beautiful. <br><br>There are so many scenes that I adore, but my favorite is when the Avengers, ""get acquainted"" with Vision for the first time. This is the second A.I. the group has encountered and they're unsure if they can trust him. Vision is uncertain himself and gives a speech on why it doesn't matter because they all want to stop Ultron. At the end of his speech there is a comedic pay-off that shows which side Vision is truly on. <br><br>The moral of the film is, ""The way to peace is not destruction."" Ultron is built for one reason - to create peace in our time. Ultron is confused on how to fulfill that mission and believes the only way to achieve his goal is to wipe out the human race and start over. However, Ultron underestimates the soul of man. <br><br>I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11- to 18 year- olds. There is language and intense action that younger kids might not be able to handle. Check out this film in theaters May 1 and remember, a true Marvel fan stays to the end of the credits.<br><br>Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

59,Avenging Always,Jen (zaileia),"The second outing of Whedon's Avengers is bound to be compared to the first, but I cannot help but simply see this movie as a bridge between the first and the third that is yet to come. Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie, but as is inevitable with ongoing series the middle part is a lot of continuation and no resolve. The opening dives straight into the action without any prelude as to how the team have reassembled after the events of Iron Man 3, Cap 2 and Thor 2. The audience are left to assume that at some point between Iron Man 3 and this movie Tony Stark decided to rebuild the Avengers after Shield went down, thus donning his armour once more. With a few episodes of Angents of Shield still to air perhaps we will get a more thorough explanation but for now one can only conclude that Stark was the driving force of the idea and Cap the elected leader. The Maximoff twins are well executed away from the forbidden mutant element, the Avengers following Coulson's terminology of enhanced persons and dancing around the potential connection to the Inhumans that we may see in the future. Without giving too much away I'll briefly touch on the romantic entanglements portrayed, the main twist meaning that many a Barton/Romanov shipper are to be disappointed. I however found the development of Barton's character to be endearing and by the end of the movie was cheering on Hawkeye more than any other Avenger, now desperate for a solo outing for the character (TV series anyone?). As for Romanov, her romantic interest seems a bit forced and probably has more to do with the chemistry between the actors than the characters. There is a spark there no doubt but from a character standpoint it makes little sense and seems to just serve to pull at our heartstrings later on when the inevitable happens. It's a pleasure to see Paul Bettany on screen at long last, his JARVIS becoming a fully formed Vision and by films end becoming a New Avenger in his own right. The myriad of cameos are enjoyable and thankfully purposeful as the end of the movie sees the New Avengers forming out of this 'B-Team', hinting at the potential for Phase 4 of Marvel's plan as the current cast's contracts start to run out. In conclusion, this movie is a wonderful continued romp through the Marvel Cinematic Universe and leaves you desperate for the next instalment and doesn't drop the ball, which as the ninth movie in the series is an achievement in itself. Let the good times keep rolling!",23 April 2015
60,My hopes have been crushed,addy-25182,"Spoilers!<br><br>I was so disappointed with Age of Ultron. As a hardcore fan of everything superhero related, I was simply appalled by the movie. Don't get me wrong the action was phenomenal, who doesn't love watching your favourite superheroes team up and beat the bad guy? Unfortunately with a subpar plot and one too many puns, the story becomes increasingly ridiculous as you sit there wondering whats so good about this movie.<br><br>The first thing that will stand out is the fact that Black Widow and Bruce Banner are a thing. If you don't recall from the first avengers, Hawkeye and Black Widow had a very strong connection that went past friendship. That seemed to have been forgotten in this movie because randomly Hawkeye has a family with a wife, two kids and another one on the way. What? Black Widow is even willing to run away with Bruce and skip out on the fight with Ultron. Say what? Since when has Widow ever wanted to miss a fight? Clearly something's wrong and it's more than love.<br><br>Secondly, what was the point of Nick Fury? He shows up to give some sort of empowering speech to Tony that'll give him the confidence to go destroy Ultron and points out Widows and Banners relationship. Where does he find all the people to run the helicarrier and how does he get it working so fast? Did he know that Ultron was going to lift an entire city off the ground? Where were those mini helicarriers in the first movie? That would've been helpful during the battle of New York.<br><br>Thirdly, since when can super villains sneak up on everyone? Scarlett Witch was able to mind control everyone present in the old ship except for Hawkeye of all people? Not even Captian America who can somehow destroy an Ultron bot with one punch without even turning around got mind controlled by her. Even Thor got hit. What was the purpose of seeing everyone's fears and regrets? Speaking of which, how come Thor can suddenly see into the future by swimming in a magic pond and how come the Doctor knows where it is?<br><br>One of the things that will bother me to no end is that fact that Iron Man beat Hulk in a one on one battle. There is no way in any possible circumstance that Iron Man can beat Hulk. Why couldn't hulk rip tony out of the suit? If all it takes to subdue the Hulk is to beat him up, why bother calming him down? The angrier Hulk is, the stronger he gets but I guess that doesn't apply in these movies.<br><br>I'm not even going to talk about Vision lifting Thor's hammer.<br><br>Finally, the one thing that makes this movie worse than the original is the fact that it didn't seem as world threatening as the first movie. Ultrons plan was to lift up a whole city and throw it back down to earth. Loki planned in invading the earth and had a whole army to do it. The only reason why the Avengers won there was because Iron Man threw a nuke at them. Not once was there a point where I felt like the Avengers was going to lose. Ultron wasn't a challenge for them, I doubt they needed all the Avengers to beat him. They never really had a down moment and all their arguments were pointless. I'd feel stupid too if I got beaten by two kids with no fighting experience.<br><br>There were barely any awe inspiring, edge of the seat moments where I thought ""wow I can't believe this is happening!"" Not to mention they defeated Ultron way too easily. Why even introduce Quicksilver and portray him as an important character if he's just going to be killed at the end?<br><br>Overall, Age of Ultron is a good movie if you're into all the flashy action and CGI but it's story is filled with plot holes and plain nonsense. Hopefully the next Avengers movie will be better but I'm not getting my hopes up.",2 May 2015
61,The worst Marvel film I've ever seen.,whodeanyescapeartist,"This review contains spoilers, you should read it anyway because it's not worth seeing. My mate fell asleep next to me, I found myself battering my head into the head rest, and a geeky guy to my left kept cackling at the in-references that most there didn't understand. They kept coming and I knew they were there because I would hear 3 or 4 nasal geeks cackle at them. In a full theatre. Everyone looked bored.<br><br>In comparison to worthy action films like the first Captain America (masterpiece), the first and even, second Thor film (beautifully shot and amazing set pieces) This was... Horrendous and made no sense immediately from the beginning. It was like I came into the cinema half way through the film. This is not a film built for people who haven't seen the other films, hell, this isn't even a film made for people who *have* seen all the other films but not the TV series and the special limited edition comic book. It's a obsessive geeks film, made for other obsessive geeks and (apologies for any antagonism caused, I'm just annoyed at how this film has damaged the cinematic universe of marvel by being so weak) nobody else will get it. I watch a lot of shield on TV and it still didn't make sense.<br><br>We join the avengers with no explanation in the middle of a fight in the forest, we don't know who they are fighting for ten minutes (we don't find out for 30 minutes and even then it relies on you having seen the last 4 movies to understand) and I immediately find myself struggling to care, as jokes are made and they effortlessly dispatch the enemy with their super powers I find myself thinking ""any army could have dealt with this, why the avengers?"" And that's the problem, the first enemy is weak, so you find yourself being confused and bored. Stark picks up Loki's sceptre and the next confusing moment comes - why was it missing in the first place, why did they know to go there for it??? This isn't explained.<br><br>We join Stark in his lab and he is experimenting on the sceptre, discovering it is a computer, not a power source, or maybe even both. He discovers this in about ten minutes, it feels like half the movie should be dedicated to such a complex piece of reverse engineering and it makes no sense that it takes 5 minutes. Stark took a whole movie to create his own power source for Iron Man, yet we're led to believe he can reverse engineer more advanced alien technology in 6 minutes. <br><br>Speaking of Stark, no characters are given backgrounds here, if you haven't seen previous films expect to understand nothing and be baffled. In comparison to other Marvel films where things make sense without background knowledge.<br><br>From here the sceptre is used to integrate an AI with the Internet or some such nonsense. Apparently before Stark couldn't do it, lacking a powerful enough computer. Yet Stark already had an AI he created so it's like wut??? A blue blob of light attacks a brown blob of light in Stark's lab and none of it makes any coherent sense in even a vagueeee way. I'm not talking it being based on actual science (although the best Marvel films suspend your disbelief and don't feel completely ridiculous), it's just literally confusing, special fx blue lights sending out lines of blue against brown blobs and apparently the Internet is invaded and I'm like wut is going onnn... The AI gets a body and blah blah blah. By now it's been 40 minutes (btw this film is soooo overlong) and nothing makes sense or is interesting or has happened of note.<br><br>From there is a series of fights, none of which are interesting as the Avenger characters are so powerful and the opposition so weak you don't even question their ability to win, making them pointless. <br><br>A character is introduced who is apparently a witch, at first she just influences minds, but by the end of the film she's suddenly developed into some sort of Keanu Reeves Matrix type person with red mist around her hands and she uses her powers to hit people with red mist and can stop bullets and it's like, um where has this come from, earlier she had to hide in a cupboard? Her character is so poorly developed that when she joins the Avengers I don't care whether she lives or dies.<br><br>I won't waste time on the new red android with the stone is his head, I don't even remember what his name is - although I note I think towards the end they started to mention his name without even explaining where it came from. He literally randomly appears in scenes and it's like ""who cares?"". Then there's the machine used to create him, it's not explained at all it's just like ""oh noes Ultron will use the machine to create a new body!!!1"". Where did the machine come from? Who knows, that could be a film in itself. It's just another deus ex machina. One that is probably better than this nonsense.<br><br>Speaking of deus ex machina, there's the bit where Samuel L Jackson pops back from death with a massive ship to save everyone in the city. Like the worst attempt to sort a bad plot ever.<br><br>Literally worse than batman and robin, that at least was meant to be a joke. How ironic that Whedon, famous for being a geek, did a worse Marvel film then Kenneth Branagh. I mean you don't think of the Shakespeare guy and think ""I bet he'd do a good film about Norse aliens"" but he does. He makes this look like a nightmarish nonsensical joke. Which it is.",7 May 2015
62,Exactly what we wanted AND needed,anyamorse,"""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is more well-balanced in comparison to the original film. There's more variety as nearly every character gets an appropriate amount of screen time. There's also this cohesive balance between the film's story and its action. It's very much about action and entertainment, but there are also new characters to introduce, a blossoming love story between two Avengers to showcase, the infinity gems to gather quietly in the background, and a new villain to develop. While Whedon's wit and sharp writing are clearly very much an integral part of the film the humor doesn't seem quite as on the mark as it was in the first film. You simply just don't laugh as much during ""Age of Ultron"" and that's a little disappointing.<br><br>The opening sequence of the film is incredible. It's pieced together as this seamless flurry of advanced weaponry, explosions, and Hulk smashing. The Ultron army circling sequence near the end of the film is just as impressive. The fight between Iron Man's Hulkbuster and Hulk is probably what everyone is looking forward to the most and it absolutely delivers. However Ultron himself may be the most enjoyable aspect of the movie. Ultron is born from a failed experiment by Tony Stark, so it's only natural that he possesses some of Tony's quips and attributes. James Spader is fantastic as Ultron. His facial expressions, body language, and hand movements are very clearly Tony Stark-inspired, but his purpose is completely monstrous and inhuman.<br><br>Tony is haunted by the nuclear wormhole he flew into at the end of the last film. In fact, it's the key element of his creation of Ultron. The camera angles utilized in the film are even more dynamic than they were in the previous film, especially during the Hulk sequences. They found a way to make the audience feel like the movie seat they're sitting in at the theater is in jeopardy of being within radius of Hulk's immeasurable wrath. Hawkeye's role in the sequel is also meatier this time around. Clint Barton proves that he's extremely essential to The Avengers team despite his lack of superhuman abilities.<br><br>While more screen time is given to the likes of Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, Thor and Captain America are seemingly left to pick up the scraps. As leader, Cap gets his fair share of one-liners and running gags but Thor's little side story is pretty weak. Excluding The Twins and Ultron, newer and additional Avengers members are practically nothing more than cameos. Introducing Vision is a cool concept, but he doesn't really do much of anything. War Machine and Falcon are mostly thrown in for one very important scene, but otherwise aren't around long enough to leave lasting impressions.<br><br>The second Avengers is better than its the original in many ways. The spotlight is spread amongst the six key members of the team much more efficiently than in the first film and the villain is a homegrown threat that is even bigger and deadlier than Loki was. The visuals and action sequences are considerably larger, as well. Even with regards to its few flaws, ""Age of Ultron"" is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying.",3 May 2015
63,Shockingly bad,bogdan314,"I am amazed of the 8.5 that this movie has right now and how people consider it good.<br><br>My 5 star note is not a hater's note. By the contrary, I went to the cinema with some hopes that this is going to be better than the previous one.<br><br>Major disappointment. The only thing good is the CGI. There are indeed very nice special effects, you can't tell the difference from the real stuff. However, this film has absolutely nothing else to give.<br><br>When will Marvel learn to make a good movie? This is even worse than Iron Man 3, can you believe it? One again they've advertised it as ""dark"", but by now we should already know what that means for them.<br><br>The action if full of non-sense, the plot is once again childish and the character interaction very superficial, cheesy and very annoying, if you come to think that this is the n-th movie with these guys. The scenes just don't tie up, they always have you wonder ""why would they do that"".<br><br>The only thing that the movie has to show you is some superheroes fighting against supposedly powerful and wicked, yet surprisingly useless, inefficient enemies. One more, you are supposed to say ""wow did you see how Thor threw that hammer?"", ""how powerful Hulk is!"" etc., and disregard any logic about what is really going on there.<br><br>You never get to care about where the plot is going. Halfway through the movie I found myself bored to death (be advised: I'm a huge fan of comic books) and always waiting for it to end.<br><br>Also, you are again supposed to believe no human is actually hurt in all those fights. Cities are destroyed, yet no one is injured.<br><br>When you see some outrageous breaking of the laws of physics, you will be without reaction, because you are already in shock of how bad this movie is.",25 April 2015
64,disappointing..,Chelsy Garc,"Me and my family watched a last full show of this film. We were in high spirits though it was already late. I have high expectations for this film since I really enjoyed the first Avengers film A LOT ( it never failed to entertain even after several viewing thru DVD). Oh gosh, I really have to force myself to enjoy this 2nd installment. I was looking for the same charm, the same heart, the same fluidity, that the first film had offered. I got bored of cheesy lines meant to be funny and somewhat ""forced"" attraction between Natasha and Bruce. The special effects are good which kept me awake though. Unlike the first one, I am not buying a DVD version of this one.",26 April 2015
65,And I'm sitting here wishing this liberal masterpiece wasn't over!,engrymfilm,"Where to start? First of all, Mrs. Joss Whedon you've done it again! I've been following this sh'man's work since Buffy and I still can't believe how consistently great, elegant, poetic, graceful, romantic, feminine yet hard, brutal, no holds barred, slamming, thrusting, dominating and masculating sh'is material has been. I come from a long line of men and women in my family and growing up around a strong female character such as my mother and a submissive yet nice guy character as my Dad, I came into my own character... I mean identity early in life. I understood immediately how a relationship between a man and a woman works and so began my long, hard, soft and wet foray into the more tasteful and equal parts of the artistic world in such mediums as cinema (or ""Kino"" for all you Krauts!), music, books, paintings, graphic novels, bicycles, cats and ethnic food. <br><br>This path eventually led me to the works of Joss Whedon. And this Whoa-Man (as in he's such a good writer it makes you go ""WHOA, MAN!"" but it's also a pun of the word woman because that's his favorite word) has taken the helm of Marvel's ultimate team of Superheroes: The Avengers! So here's the deal: How does Whedon write such strong female characters? You have Black Widow and let's be honest, even though her screen time and salary is a fraction of her male co-stars she still kicks ass as in the woman can really fight! But wait, it doesn't end there because we're introduced to Scarlet Witch and guess what? she kicks ass, too in her collected 10 minutes of screen time! she has strong, telekinetic, female character powers. And let's not forget S.H.I.E.L.D Agent Maria Hill who only has a combined screen time of maybe 5 minutes in a 140 minute movie but you know what? when she shows up, she kicks ass! There's so much girl power in this movie that you instantly forget that the rest of the characters taking up a majority of the film's running time are male. But we have a big bad wolf in the film's main villain: Ultron. This pulsing man-machine symbol of the Patriarchy is on a throbbing rampage to destroy the entire world. Typical male, am I right? *owl face. Ultron tears and rips through so many walls, pounding and destroying whatever is spread out in front of him you almost think no one has a chance.<br><br>Then something glorious happens in the character of Vision. Like an angel he gracefully enters an opening in the story with such a delicate touch, slow yet careful and with passion and a most extreme sensual connection he helps the Avengers to defeat Ultron. But of course it wouldn't be Whedon if a woman wasn't there to aid him because Scarlet Witch is also a big factor in the big, exploding climax. She absolutely gushes with such power that the combined force of her and Vision opens up a whole new, unlabeled form of partnership that has yet to buzz up in our own society. These characters are the absolute objects of my affection<br><br>If you want a definition of Whedon's artistic vision you would be wrong to think it was lumpy, pasty, receding in quality, or sausagely-fingered in its themes as that would be shaming his entire body of work. His career is to define what it is to be a woman and I haven't seen equality like this since the outcome of Roe v Wade. The Bodhi Dharma once said: ""Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it"". I imagine when he put down his writing chopstick afterwards he never would have thought his words would give a natural birth to the baby mind of one Joss Whedon. Keep on writing, Mister Sister 'cuz, baby, you're a firefly!",17 April 2015
66,This is why you pay the ticket!,palavitsinis,"Well, I watched it last night and I am still amazed and thinking about it! Truly one of the greatest marvel movies. I read some of the negative reviews from other users and I have to say that I don't understand them. Sometimes it feels like they paid a ticket to see a marvel movie, and then they expected some kind of Oscar winning performance and some deep and meaningful life-inspiring story. No. That's not it. If you expect that, look for another movie. <br><br>For me, this kind of movies is like having single-flavor smoothies, like lemon or orange or strawberry, and then, one day a guy comes and says, ""do you want them all in one?"". That's actually it. Iron man, Thor, Hulk and Captain America, some very successful characters, all-in-one! What more can you ask for? <br><br>I really liked the depiction of the different characters and how they all blended and interact with one another. It's really nice how each character keeps its own uniqueness and how they also blend together, creating some amazing moments. I really appreciated the humor of the movie which was really useful to break the tension in many points during the story. <br><br>The Ultron was AMAZING as a villain as well as the Vision. The movie was packed with action and had an amazing flow that made you think you were already 1h30m into the movie, when it was actually only 45 minutes. Scenes that were too much even for such a movie were significantly less than the first movie. I really liked the way some parallel stories evolve and I was really happy to see in the end how the movie leaves room for another one.",7 May 2015
67,Amazing movie ! (No spoilers),davidjr2008,"I was reading some of the post and seemed very surprised at the few low ratings , I know you can't please everyone. All of the fighting scenes were spectacular I never got bored , even through the slower parts I enjoyed the whole movie. I think that the humor in it was great , and realistic . You get that much testosterone in a group everyone will try to one up everyone else, In real life as well. I saw it in iMax(the huge screens) 3D , so that definitely added to the excitement , I don't go see movies any more in regular screen ever since imax 3D. I strongly recommend going to see it like that ! It is an unforgettable experience. Also on a side note guys that get disappointed I don't feel bad for because just like with everything in life if you expect something a certain way and it doesn't meet your expectations you are going to get let down ! But if you have none or at the very least lower your expectations you will see how much of a difference it is . Go in with an open mind , don't be so closed minded people. Just saying !",5 May 2015
68,A prefect summer movie,Gianluca Marzano,"Avengers: Age Of Ultron is the squeal to the avengers(2012). Age Of Ultron is about when Tony Stark tries to make a robot called Ultron. It's meant to save the world but things go wrong and now they have to get every avenger and more people to stop Ultron. First off, Age Of Ultron was amazing and blew the first avengers out of the water. Everything was more fun, and raised the stakes to a whole another level. Now, there are some parts of the movie that felt not needed for this movie but you know that it will become a bigger piece in the MCU. What makes age of Ultron great as the first one is seeing all the avengers together. The old cast is great as before and with the addition of the new characters, it's just better. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were great additions to the MCU. The one person who stole the whole movie was Hawkeye. He had a lot more screen time and much more character development. Overall Avengers: Age Of Ultron was an amazing movie, much smarter and fun than any other marvel movie yet. A must watch In the theaters. Great start to the summer movies of 2015.",30 April 2015
69,Avengers Age of Ultron Review - SPOILERS,frymypants,"The main issue with this film is certainly the pacing, its condensed story structure leaves very little time to really absorb each character, there are too many subplots running throughout the film.<br><br>Iron Man's self destructive trend, Scarlett Witch's and Quicksilver's character arcs, Ultron's justification for the end of the world, Vision's choice to be for humanity, Hulk and Black Widow's romance and their own feelings about their place in the world, Hawkeye's background, minor characters making cameo arcs and with that comes at least an hour of fight sequences (ala Man of Steel influence). Excess would be the sin of this film and lack of moments of self reflection effects the film in a non positive manner.<br><br>Problems begin with starting with a big fight sequence that takes you completely out of the characterisation and puts them in an objectified position, it should have really slowly reintroduced to you to the world instead of heading in.<br><br>The problems continues with Aaron Taylor-Johanson's Russian accent which was just off putting for some reason and his limited time for characterisation did not leave you weeping for like Coulson.<br><br>Ultron's flawed design and Metallic lip movements seemed unnecessary for a robot and expensive and also he wasn't as interesting a Loki. The amount of robots brought back unwanted nostalgia for the climaxes of Iron Man 2 and 3. This after all not a Transformers franchise!! Vision in my opinion was fine, he looked good to me, and his connection to Scarlett Witch was watchable.<br><br>However Thor was completely underused and just knowing where to put the infinity stone at that specific moment in time is a moment that cannot suspend disbelief.<br><br>The jokes mainly felt, due to pacing issues and tonal difference, kinda like bad throwaway one liners though some of the landed appropriately however what I did need fleshed out was Black Widow's hide the zucchini talent, that would have been very entertaining.<br><br>The choreography for the fight scenes were ambitious and watched by themselves is an excellent example of superhero team fight, but in this film often messy in relation to its story structure. Captain America's fight sequences being fundamentally my favourite.<br><br>What this film can't compare to it's predecessor, organic moments of characterisation and visual comedy. The first team-up, the battle for New York, ""Always being Angry"", the big ""Owie"", ""Hulk vs Thor"", ""Hulk saving Iron Man"""", ""having red in your ledger"" and ""mewling quim"". The lack of memorability for me at least is what causes the root of my disappointment in this film.<br><br>That's why I cannot give it a 7.0, Whedon can do better he's an organic writer who got caught up in an overly ambitious plan to tell an entire season of Buffy in 2.20 hrs. Stripping it down, even building up the flash backs from the very beginning to the last one where Scarlett Witch attached to Tony would have worked better, even at a sense of mystery why the flashbacks occurred to create that tension and maybe push it more toward they Arne't fears actual vision of what can occur would be thematically more interesting.<br><br>Final verdict 6.8/10",25 April 2015
70,Impressive Special Effects and Cast,Claudio Carvalho,"The Avengers raid a Hydra base in Sokovia commanded by Strucker and they retrieve Loki's scepter. They also discover that Strucker had been conducting experiments with the orphan twins Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who has super speed, and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), who can control minds and project energy. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) discovers an Artificial Intelligence in the scepter and convinces Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) to secretly help him to transfer the A.I. to his Ultron defense system. However, the Ultron understands that is necessary to annihilate mankind to save the planet, attacks the Avengers and flees to Sokovia with the scepter. He builds an armature for self-protection and robots for his army and teams up with the twins. The Avengers go to Clinton Barton's house to recover, but out of the blue, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives and convinces them to fight against Ultron. Will they succeed? <br><br>""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is an entertaining adventure with impressive special effects and cast. The storyline might be better, since most of the characters do not show any chemistry. However, it is worthwhile watching this film since the amazing special effects are not possible to be described in words. Why Pietro has to die is also not possible to be explained.

71,A spectacle to watch!!,Jay Mehta,"With a mountain of expectations this movie went to the floors and pulled off something very few movies are able to. In fact, IMHO, none of the movies so far, has done it as brilliantly as Avengers AOU.<br><br>One thing which I liked the most about the movie was that it involved a bit of story to every single thing happening and was narrated in beautiful as well as very convincing manner. Nothing was defying logic or didn't make sense. Although Hollywood writers have a very good hand at developing a convincing plot to their story, Avengers AOU took it to another level. <br><br>Visually the movie scores more than 10 on 10. Some really great graphics work has been accomplished at Marvel Studios last year and early this year. You can see this in the 141 minute entertainer. The Scarlett Johansson bike scene distinctly reminds you of Carrie-Anne Moss Ducati chase of Matrix Reloaded. <br><br>The acting has been beyond expectations and none of the actors disappoint, irrespective of the screen time they get. Like the earlier version, the movie is able to give justice to each and every super hero, be it in terms of importance given in the story or the screen time. As some of the leaked reports would have already told, the epic battle between Iron Man and Hulk is worth waiting for and is spectacular. <br><br>At the end, ,just like Fast and Furious 6 left everyone waiting for FF7, Avengers - AOU keeps you waiting for Avengers 3. Just hope it doesn't disappoint like FF7 did, because the standards set by AOU is very very high.",26 April 2015
72,Redefining the word Avenging,Garrett Orange,"If, and, where The Avengers failed to captivate audiences, The Avengers Age of Ultron succeed, and in may ways excelled. There are numerous ways that this movie could be reviewed. Compared to the first one, or as an individual movie itself. Generally second movies have always fallen prey to the sequel syndrome, where the hopes and expectations of the film are let down; this is not that sequel. The movie itself is so gripping of excitement that one does not need to provide any spoilers to divulge just how breathtaking it will leave you, or more so excited. Each and every scene offers something new. Where the first movie was more about how the Avengers come to be, this movie shows the mentality and development of each character and why they are who they are respectively. The one thing that genuinely makes this film stand apart is the technology. Again, without spoiling, there are so many parts that make this a world that can be, but has yet to happen. Alien technology aside, which is a hard thing when talking about the Avengers, the human tech has been beefed up in a very realistic and futuristic way. Each and every fight scene gets better and better throughout the movie, and the characters themselves make the movie. So many laughs, so many twist, many where the action was less than a second beforehand, and you are still asking how and why, but there is no time to think. That is not an issue though, it all gets explained. The cause for a 9 rating instead of a perfect 10 is that there are some gaps. Questions of how he or she got there so fast, almost making it look like they teleported, but that was not the case. Overall, Avengers Age of Ultron is thus far the best action movie of 2015, and with respects to Marvel, the best franchise movie yet. What the future holds for Marvel has yet to be revealed, but there are clues. When the next movie is released, the battle to save the earth, to save mankind, will need more heroes than the ones that have already captivated the theatrical world.",30 April 2015
73,A marvelous addition to the MCU,cherubster122,"Hopefully there are no spoilers in this review. Avengers: Age of Ultron is the marvel film we've all been waiting for. It's the marvel film we've needed for so long. Joss Whedon masterfully directed a work of art with this film. There are scenes that tug at the emotions, some making you feel exceptionally excited, some rather sad, and at times somewhat creeped out. He brings together a combination of comedy, drama, plenty of action, and even a little love. Bringing in new characters to the universe, shedding light on some who needed it, and even bringing some old ones back. <br><br>All the actors give amazing performances, as to be expected. James Spader, as Ultron, being one of the highlights of the film. Clever, comical, sinister and oh so intimidating. Spader furthering upon the comical and serious sides the film portrays with the way he employs his unique voice. Ultron has some moments where if Spader had not been voicing him, they wouldn't have had the same effect. With some incredible dialogue scenes, and some awesome one-liners, Spader made you fall in love with Ultron in a way you wouldn't expect. Paul Bettany, also made an even greater splash into the MCU, after being Jarvis, by bringing Vision to the big screen. Playing the part exceptionally well, he brings the character to life, and makes you trust him with some rather comical scenes. Later on in the film he starts showing off some awesome fighting skills, which leave you wanting more. With some great confrontational scenes with Ultron, he shows his good-neutral character alignment, stating he is ""For life"". Hopefully we see more of Vision in the future MCU, because he was an awe inspiring character whom I felt should have had a little more screen time and action. But hey... At least we got him. The Maximoff twins were played brilliantly by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Playing Pietro 'Quicksilver' Maximoff, and Elizabeth Olsen, as the Scarlett Witch or Wanda Maximoff. Both having scenes where you can't help but connect to them, and love them. Aaron bringing out the comical side of the films once again, with some incredibly well written scenes. Segwaying into how he and Jeremy Renner's character, Hawkeye coincided, having some brilliantly banter between the two of them which left everyone laughing. And more segwaying with Hawkeye and Wanda connecting in some great ways, with some rather comical yet serious interactions between the two. Elizabeth played Wanda exceptionally well, showing her connection to her brother in a phenomenal way. Both also have great scenes with Ultron.<br><br>Though mostly consistent, there were a few plot holes, or scenes that could have been expanded upon, though not enough to mark the film down. I would expand on this topic further, but I'm trying to avoid dropping spoilers. <br><br>All in all, the most recent addition to the MCU was a truly amazing film, I was completely enveloped into the world, connecting with all the characters, either again or for the first time. Joss Whedon wrote and directed what may be the highlight of his career so far. It is easily among my top five films now, and currently standing at the top of this years film charts for me. It is most certainly going to be a hard one to knock down! And just a heads up; there is only one credits scene.",21 April 2015
74,Very disjointed,Atli Hafsteinsson,"What bothers me most about Age of Ultron is that it can't decide on what kind of tone it wants to set. Some of the old Marvel spirit that balances fun with character arcs and themes is struck here, but a lot of the time, this film is just depressing too. The themes get quite dark, almost DC dark at times, and that worries me, 'cause I think the Marvel movies have done a better job with the whole comic-book movie thing than DC have. Hope this is not a sign of things to come.<br><br>Furthermore, all plot and character development seems to have been thrown out the window. The first Avengers worked because it was the perfect melting pot for all of these characters' stories and character development at the time. Captain America was still getting used to life in the 21st century, and of course Loki and Thor's story was in direct continuation to the movie Thor. In Age of Ultron, the same attempt at character and story unity is just messy. I thought Steve Rogers (and Falcon) was going to search for Bucky Barnes, did he just put that on hold? On the whole, the Cap was underused in this movie, as was Thor (my two faves). And the whole romance thing with Natasha and Bruce only works because of the wonderful performances by Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo. These characters have never shown the slightest bit of chemistry together before, now suddenly we're told that they have a crush on each other. After a movie where the Cap and Romanoff had a lot of chemistry together. Sure.<br><br>Also, maybe it's just me, but I just didn't care as much about the fictional city, because, well, it's fictional. We've already established that these characters live in a world tangent to our own, and Loki's invasion on Manhattan felt far more visceral to the audience 'cause we could relate to it. Not setting the final battle in an actual Eastern European location really damaged my investment in it. I really, really like Ultron as a character, though, and his personality kept me excited. But how he and Jarvis were connected might've gone over the heads of many in the audience.<br><br>You will not walk away from this film all energized like after the first Avengers. Instead, you'll feel like this is the end of an era. Pros to Elizabeth Olsen for a great character, but as a Marvel movie, Age of Ultron is messy to say the least.",20 July 2015

76,The best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far (spoiler free),apstylianou,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is exactly what I wanted it to be, a fine sequel with solid pacing, directing, acting, eye gouging special effects and awesome action sequences. Before going to see this film, I looked back to the greatest movie sequels ever to make a comparison, Terminator 2, The Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight, (I haven't seen The Godfather Part II yet), and Avengers: Age of Ultron is definitely on the same level as all of those films. My favourite film in the MCU was undeniably Guardians of the Galaxy, but I gotta say that AOU is the best Marvel movie ever since GOTG.<br><br>The cast did a fantastic job, and I literally mean each and every one of them. Robert Downey, Jr. threw it down, Chris Evans is there shining in his well-acted portrayal as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth is at his very best, Scarlett Johanson is also at her very badass best (and quite flirtatious as well I might add), Mark Ruffalo was amazing as Bruce Banner/Hulk, but Jeremy Renner stood out to me on top of all of the team. He's not my favourite Avenger, but Hawkeye was at first to me the least important guy on the team, and I thought that because he had a lack of character development in the first Avengers, but now they've done a terrific improvement on his character and they have developed him much better this time with quite an emotional core and some very good one-liners.<br><br>The newcomers, I can say, without hesitation, the same for as well. Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron-Taylor Johnson did a brilliant job as the two mutant twins. I do think that Evan Peters was a better version of Quicksilver when he played him in X-Men: Days of Future Past. Paul Bettany as the Vision was a show-stealer as well and he offered us his best in a well directed superhero movie. However, the newcomers all pale in comparison to James Spader's Ultron. I can see now why the cast and crew applauded him for his performance. Ultron was the real show stealer of the film and probably the best villain in the MCU and he is definitely up there with the greatest movie villains of all time, even reaching the same level as The Joker and Darth Vader. Whenever he's on screen, the movie sets the dark mood.<br><br>So all in all, this is one of my favourite superhero movies ever and better than the first Avengers film in my opinion. It has a well placed focus on the title characters, the Avengers and Ultron, and after that, it has an awesome set up to Phase 3.<br><br>My one problem with it is that the film wasn't as dark as the trailers suggested it would be. I just think that there should've been a little more to set the mood. It definitely does set the mood as dark as it was in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I will say that.<br><br>Still, I strongly recommend you see this one. Do not miss it.",30 April 2015
77,Not that good,wbagot1,"I knew when it was the ""action"" sequence and I was getting bored that I was in trouble.<br><br>To sum it up, each of the Avengers destroys dozens of the enemy. You're basically watching a duck hunt instead of something suspenseful. They try to hype up how dangerous it is, then each of the Avengers, no matter how powerful, suddenly becomes super powerful when it comes to destroying the enemy. The writers seemed to think that just having an action sequence was enough. That the people watching would just coo over seeing things destroyed. I wanted more.<br><br>*** Spoiler Ahead ***<br><br>Okay, then you have the one ""unexpected"" death. Which frankly was dumb. He was easily fast enough to move the targets out of the way and instead chooses to shield them with his body. I can only assume he was tired of living and wanted to commit suicide. It just made no sense.<br><br>Then you have the dramatic reactions to the death ... during the battle ... while civilians are still dying and you're still fighting ... for someone you basically just met. I realize this is common in movies. I just don't like it.<br><br>I don't want to make it sound like this is a 2 rating or something like that. The movie is still has the marvel heroes and it still creates a pretty good setting. It's just pretty pale when compared to the original, hence a 6.",31 October 2017
78,The movie... gives a huge amount of awfully tasting disappointment,iammandarin,"First of all, this movie is the wost so far. Of course it's completely accurate to the ""great Marvel system of humor"", but it sucks. Lets's dig into it all.<br><br>1). Epic slow-motion. Seriously. Enough of it. Please.

The movie is pg 13, and it absolutely does't have any chance to beat any humor score with jokes like ""Watch your language!"". <br><br>3). Ruined characters. This movie continues the awful tradition of the Iron Man 3 movie - Tony Stark is in a state of permanent hysterics, but here it has a different angle - building Terminators. No matter the cost. The carefully and perfectly (in a close-to-comic book style) introduced by John Favreau image of Iron Man\Tony Stark is blown to pieces. The other members of the ""team"" are also terrible. Somehow black Widow and Hulk are in a stupid out of nowhere involvement, Hawkeye has a family (which stays on screen for painfully long 15 minutes), Thor has no idea where's Jane, but can find his friend-professor just instantly etc. etc.<br><br>4). Terrible lack timing for characters. War machine has about 8 seconds of action and than is ""ordered"" by stark to attend the evacuation - that is compared to, well, like 5 minutes of screen time for Hawkeye's wife, Some people screaming and running, Some woman and her child etc. etc. <br><br>5). Thins movie isn't - a. a movie at all; b. they didn't even try to create in a way to please COMIC-BOOK fans. Seriously! This movie is a mixture of awful approaches on the iconic characters. I won't even speak about the putting-him-out-of -story for one of them!<br><br>To conclude, I just want to say that the movie isn't worth watching. All the action sequence - you can get via trailers and released character scenes (as for the character of Vision for example). The rest of the movie - is stupid talk and pointless bad acting. With no purpose whatsoever..",24 April 2015
79,"How is this movie an 8.0, when most reviews are bad?? How is that even possible??",pensacolacomputer,"For those of us who were disappointed with this movie, and judging by most of the reviewers here (who are not fake), a lot of us were disappointed I was semi entertained but to me being marginally entertained is NOT good enough for a movie of this caliber that costs 1/4 of a billion dollars to make!<br><br>I guess I expected more from this movie. The trailer made it seem like it was going to be a home run but this barely got to first base. This was more like the last transformers movie, mindless, stupid action that catered to 15 year olds. The script was bad, WAY TOO MANY one liners(most were not funny at all), way too many characters and not enough explanation, and that's just the start of it, I could go on and on. This was just an overall disappointment that certainly should not be a 8.0, not even close. Even most of the reviewers here that gave it a 8, 9, or 10 complained in their review about a lot of things. And they still gave it a very high score? Doesn't make sense, so I am doing the only thing I can which to to tell all my friends how horrible this movie was and never purchase the DVD.<br><br>Sorry Marvel and Disney but you better start doing a whole lot better or you will not be getting any more money from me!

80,Why do artists destroy their own great creations. Avengers was a team we admired so much. The sequel is a heart-breaking disappointment,dreamworkswb01,"There are more than a few problems with this new Avengers movie. I don't know where to start. For beginning, there was no need to extend the film so long. There were many useless scenes that could have been avoided for good. After watching such a long movie, you expect to see some big thing happening in the end. I'm sorry I kept on waiting for that big thing but it never came. In the first film, it was Iron Man saving the city from a nuke that was a big thing, which ended the movie. This brings me to the next problem, you just can't say where actually the Avengers finished their job. It seems that the director did not sleep enough when he was finishing the last 10 minutes of the movie. Last then minutes were more devoted to the sequel of this sequel. Some people here say that Avengers 2 is better than Avengers 1, but I don't find any reason behind that. There were dialogs in Avengers one that inspired us and made us love the team. Rather in this movie, Nick Fury's role was diluted. There was creativity in the fighting scenes of the first movie, but fighting scenes of this movie were mostly boring, except for one scene. Avengers 2 had burden of our great expectations but it was not even near to the first one. You will not find amazing dialogs like ""I'm always angry"", ""I didn't argue with the god that did"", ""puny god"". If you are coming to see Hulk play an interesting role, stay home. The movie is overly burdened with emotional dialogs and sermons. It pains to see one of my all-time favorite movies have a sequel like this.",25 April 2015
81,The director couldn't catch the achievement of the first,Deniz Ziya Toroslu,"The Avengers Age of Ultron starts out with a soulless and pointless action sequence and the rest of the movie is not much different than this part. Since we don't know our heroes fight for who and why, we don't get excited for the adventure that our heroes have. Then, somehow, the cinematography is lifeless, the technical craftsmanship accomplishment is boring. Everything is too mechanic here. The villain of the movie is an artificial intelligence, again ""mechanic"". Everything about this villain is so clich√© from his words to his evil plans to destroy the world, humanity, whatever. In the first movie, almost everything was perfect. This second installment is lack of heart and soul and an exciting adventure. The movie was like an empty roller coaster ride. The action and the fight scenes are uninspiring, lifeless. Everything happens just so quickly and it is overblown. Another thing the movie was lack of is the tension or clash between the allies. What makes the first movie spectacular was the sweet conflicts among the heroes. Returning to Ultron, it was not intimidating, not hilarious like Loki, honestly, it is just a machine! (Terminator fans, please don't be offended, this is a different case) In contrast with the promises by the director, this is not a darker movie. This is a boring action film. For example, adding romance into a movie doesn't make it deeper or sophisticated. Action is soulless and completely forgettable here except for two scenes. The first and the best is Hulk vs. Hulbuster scene which was fairly done. I have seen it dozens of times. The second one is the highway chase with Captain America and Black Widow, but it was like a copy of The Matrix Reloaded and nothing new. From the beginning, I don't like the appearance or the manners of this new Hulk (the first is favorite), but Hulk is OK here. The second half of the movie focuses on destruction like Man of Steel in a bad way. Do you want to hear Iron Man's witty comments? Thor's majesty? Captain America's work discipline? Hulk's anger? None of them is here. Loki? I miss him. Unfortunately, Quicksilver loses the game from the first minute, because we had seen a brilliant Quicksilver before. Scarlett Witch bewitched me, but I just couldn't get warm to her. I hope I will start to love her in future installments. Vision was completely unnecessary. Hulk is not like a gorilla or a fun mascot here which is good, but he is used like a pawn in this movie. Finally, Age of Ultron is sometimes dreadful, sometimes cheesy, sometimes dull, sometimes pretentious and mostly soulless sequel. I am very happy that the next adventures are going to be directed by Russo Brothers who gave us terrific ""The Winter Soldier"".",20 March 2016

84,Great Movie.  Why the Hate?,erkucz00,"Like an idiot, I took what I read on the internet about this movie to be true. I went to the theater with rather low expectations, only to have my mind blown by the cinematic masterpiece that was Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br><br>For starters, the acting was great. The Avengers were great as usual, and Jeremy Renner showed a different side of Clint Barton. And then there's Ultron, played by James Spader. I knew he'd be good, but my word! Someone give that man an Oscar! Even with the CGI motion capture, Ultron's character was at the same time incredibly robotic, and amazingly human. As a side note, Andy Serkis also did very well as klaw, despite the fact he only had a few scenes. <br><br>There's also the thing that most people went to the theater to see. The action scenes. All of the avengers powers were well showcased. Especially Quicksilver's in the slo-mo parts. The battles were filled with numerous ""Holy Crap!"" moments. If you stumble upon the message board post calling the fighting predictable, ignore it.<br><br>Ultimately, this was a fun movie. Don't get me wrong, I love a good Nolan film, and the daredevil show is one of my faveorites, but thismovie was just fun to watch. It's 2.5 hour run time wasn't exhausting, and the playful humor never got old. <br><br>If you are looking for a gritty, pulpy film full of mystery and political intruigue, this isn't for you.

85,"A fun, comedic and action packed film that lived up to all expectations",stephendaxter,"Avengers Age of Ultron was one of the biggest and most anticipated movies of the year and it did not disappoint. This movie was everything you want an avengers movie to be, a near perfect blend between Action, Comedy, and character development. I felt that they handled the large cast fairly well with each of the avengers getting a good amount of screen time. But it isn't just the individual characters that makes it so entertaining, it is the chemistry between the characters that works so well. All of the subplots and jokes that they carry throughout the film stay interesting and really elevate the film. The comedy is exactly what you expect from an avengers film, the back and forth jokes work to really lighten the mood and give it that Marvel film feel, even Ultron sneaks a few jokes in a couple of times.Now let's talk about the action, this film had plenty of action sequences from start to finish and they are just so fun and exciting and you are on the edge of your seat at all times. The way the film finds ways to capture all these characters fighting at the same time in a way so that you can see everything that happens is amazing. <br><br>Ultron was definitely an awesome villain and maybe the strongest and best villain the Marvel universe has seen so far. He is so evil that when he is on screen you feel his presence and how intimidating he is. He really adds a lot to the plot and makes the film so much more entertaining in both the action scenes and plot driven scenes. Speaking of the plot, the subplots I thought all worked really well and the main plot for the most part was really interesting. I just thought that the first half of the film felt a little messy as it tried to setup Ultron and some other characters while trying to still include the characters we have known so far. The jumping between locations and all that could have been refined a little better, but they did what they had to do within the runtime. But that is the only issue I had with the film and a minor one at that. Everything else gelled together so well and created one of the best (and my favourite) movies of the year so far. If you love Marvel films and action films in general I believe you will love this fun, action packed film. - 9.5",22 April 2015
86,Wonderful Marvel Addition,traumaqueen-56039,"First, I would like to thank the all-star cast for coming together to make ""The Avengers"" movies possible. They do a great job of being comfortable enough around each other to make the comedic banter between characters lively, amusing, and believable.<br><br>I have read many reviews complaining about the storyline and Ultron himself. Do not let these discourage you from the film, especially if you like the actors involved. I feel like anyone who is overly-critical or flat out dislikes this movie must have something against the actors chosen to portray the roles of the Avengers. It is too bad some people aren't fond of the actors, but I cannot understand why. These are A-List actors/actresses that America loves for their numerous critically-acclaimed performances beforehand.<br><br>This movie may contain my favorite Stan Lee cameo of all the Marvel movies.

The movie didn't waste anytime getting into full swing. After the battle we get introduced to the one and only Ulton voiced by the amazing James Spader who did an amazing job with the character making him menacing and intimidating. My favorite hero in this movie had to be Scarlet Witch who's powers were amazing to watch especially in 3D. The movie was definitely darker toned than the last Avengers which made it even more enjoyable to see something different in a Marvel movie.

89,Age of Ultron? More like Age of BOREDOM!,preppy-3,"Bad sequel to the fantastic 2012 ""The Avengers"". Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) attempt to jumpstart a system to keep peace all over the Earth. Things go wrong and they create a being called Ultron (voiced by James Spader) who sets out to destroy all humans. It's up to the Avengers to stop them but he's helped by the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).<br><br>This sequel is just terrible. The script is kind of vague in specifics about why Ultron hates humans and the Avengers so much. Also the dialogue here is TERRIBLE! No actor could put over the lines these people are given. So, understandably, almost all the acting is bad. Only Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow), Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) give good performances. Worst of all the three new superheroes--Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and The Vision--are very badly introduced and poorly used. Also the movie is far too long at almost 150 minutes and is more boring than exciting. Yes the special effects are flawless and there are a few very exciting and long action sequences but they can't save the movie. At the end the movie takes a disastrous turn and turns in a Transformers like movie! Boring and pointless with bad acting and dialogue. I give it a 5 for the effects and action.",13 May 2015
90,Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed,mistoppi,"Joss Whedon's writing is decent, but if something bothers me, it's the cheap jokes. They are used constantly, and they just are so cheesy and almost forced. Most of the audience loved them though, so maybe that works to some kind of audience.<br><br>The structure of the plot was very similar to the first Avengers, though that isn't a surprise. I don't think anyone is expecting a complicated, mind-blowing plot. The story is simple, it's decent. The fight scenes seemed much clearer this time, it was a lot easier to see what was happening and where, and who was involved. I don't know if it was just due to cinematography or effects, or the fact that I was watching a 2D version.<br><br>I was kind of hoping more from Ultron. I wanted a character who was actually scary, a villain you couldn't defend. Well, you probably can't really defend Ultron, except for the obvious ¬ñ him being a robot. But he still seemed too likable. He was kind of too humane, almost funny. James Spader was wonderful though, and his voice alone was enough to make Ultron scary when needed.<br><br>The movie had its funny moments, exciting moments, pseudo-deep moments, and the weirdly surprising moments. But why did they need to add romance? It seemed sort of forced.<br><br>In short, Avengers Age of Ultron is decent, so don't get your expectations high.

93,The road to hell is paved with good intentions,www.ramascreen.com,"AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON is simply amazing<br><br>When it comes to superhero movies such as this, I always try to look beyond whether or not the adaptation is faithful to the material, because the audiences who'll be watching this movie aren't just comic book nerds, but also some of us who may have been a late bloomer or may have been only fans of just the movies, or still would have to wikipedia things to catch up. And I'm glad that writer/director Joss Whedon has that ability to make his ""Avengers"" movies engaging and inclusive, like an open door inviting everyone to come in instead of saying 'Well, if you don't know what's up, then tough luck.' If you've seen 2012's blockbuster, ""The Avengers"" which showed the rough start of how these individuals tried to work together as a team, well, you'll be glad to know that in the opening sequence of ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"" we see them working in harmony as a team, they have a clear plan, everybody's got their job and everybody knows what they're supposed to be doing, Cap is leading, they all have each other's back, the whole sequence is like a well-oiled machine. But because of that, Whedon knows that he has to throw a curve ball, these ""Avengers"" movies are about teamwork, and so as a coach, Whedon has to throw in some kind of challenge that would make or break this team, to see if they could grow through obstacles and at first those obstacles come in the form of the twins: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who had a rough background, a rough upbringing, they're motivated by spite and distrust towards others, which is why when Ultron comes along, they share something in common or so they think.<br><br>In the comics, Ultron, as I understand it, was created by Hank Pym, but in Marvel Cinematic Universe, in this movie, Ultron is created by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) Do you remember the old saying ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions,"" that's the theme that Whedon is going with for this sequel. In the name of peace, Stark and Banner create an artificial intelligence that they hope would help them protect earth from any impending threat. But this A.I. blames humanity for everything, for not being able to reach such targeted peace. Refusing to be Stark's puppet, Ultron manufactures himself, regenerates himself, in other words clones himself into an army of killer robots. In ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron,"" you'll also get to see tension rising between Cap and Stark, at one point it got so bad, you're like ""Whoah, Whedon, save some for the Russos and their 'Civil War' movie, will ya"" but it all boils down to that teamwork again. Taking it upon yourself because you think it's for the greater good VS. talking it out as a team and respecting the collective decision.<br><br>The movie is way bigger than the first one, not just in terms of scope or locations, because it's more than just one major city in the United States, it has gone global now, and you can just feel it that the battlegrounds would only go even more colossal from this point on, it expands from one place to a few different places and it's eventually going to be about the whole planet and even outer space, I just can't wait for how much more epic it's going to be in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" movies. But ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"" is also bigger in terms of the cast. Whedon had a daunting task of making sure that each of the characters has their moment in the sun. The film's runtime is no longer than 2012's ""The Avengers"" but I think fans will be divided on how they would receive some of the ways Whedon explored the characters in this sequel. The romance between Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Cap vs. Stark, Ultron Vs. Stark, The Vision (Paul Bettany) trying to prove himself worthy of being part of the good guys, the twins and their dilemma, some fans might try to analyze which of those subplots seems forced or balanced and some fans may favor one over the other. But I think fans will be happy to see that Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) gets more story this time around. And I think fans can agree that James Spader as Ultron could not be a more perfect choice. Obviously, this is not the first movie in the history of cinema to introduce a killer robot, but Spader infuses his charisma, his commanding voice, he's so articulate, he can persuade, influence, and convince you, this Ultron makes such a strong case, a strong argument, you can't help but somewhat agree with him to a certain level and I don't think anybody other than Spader could've better delivered that.<br><br>Is ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"" as equally spectacular as 2012's ""The Avengers?"" Not quite, but it's still an amazing feat nonetheless. It's got outstanding VFX, really cool cinematic set pieces and awesome cinematography that make this team look and move seamlessly like a work of art. It's a great blend of visual and story. It's action-packed and it's fun. The tone is way darker than the first movie but it's still got tons of that Whedon's sense of humor. If you're invested in the comic books, or if you're invested in only the previous Marvel movies leading up to this, you will all get catered to.

94,"In character and theme much darker and more complex a sequel than its predecessor, Joss Whedon creates yet another immensely satisfying Avengers chapter",moviexclusive,"If the first 'Avengers' movie was about building the team, then this one is about tearing them apart.<br><br>If you've read the books, you'll know that Ultron's foremost purpose is to put the Avengers in the ground ¬ñ which in writer-director Joss Whedon's interpretation, becomes a symbol of grand irony. After all, Ultron was Tony's idea of creating an artificial intelligence which could protect mankind and so make the Avengers obsolete, a project which he happened to be working in secret with Bruce and his personal A.I. assistant Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany). Unfortunately for him, Ultron has taken the obsoletion of the Avengers quite literally, and determined for himself that the only way for mankind to survive is for it to be annihilated and thereby given a chance to evolve.<br><br>That the Avengers will face Ultron and his army of replicas is a given, but what truly surprises is the twisty character-driven narrative which Whedon weaves to get to that jaw-dropping finale. You would already have heard of the high-profile additions Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), a pair of tightly-knit Eastern European siblings whose powers of speed and mind control respectively lend their reference here as ""enhancements"" ¬ñ and besides Ultron, the brother-and-sister pair become the most formidable threat to the Avengers, in particular the latter's psychic powers which she uses on Captain America, Black Widow and Thor to trigger memories of their past and face their personal demons. <br><br>While their visions leave them distracted and unsettled, the rest of the team are also forced to confront their own fears. Tony's hubris, once the driving force of his pioneering spirit, could very well be the end of the Avengers and the destruction of everything he's tried to build. Bruce loathes his alter-ego, but recognises that his powers are still a valuable addition to the team, especially in protecting Black Widow, with whom he shares a deepening romantic interest hinted at in the last movie. And freed from the shackles of Loki's spell, Hawkeye is reminded of his mortality as one with no special powers or metal suit other than being an excellent archer, beautifully portrayed in a sojourn at the halfway mark that he makes to his 'safe house' to visit his wife and kids along with the rest of his teammates to recuperate and re-group.<br><br>It is no small feat juggling so many characters in the same movie, and yet again, Whedon has pulled it off stunningly. Even though each is part of a larger team, no one fades into it; instead, Whedon lets us get to know each and every one of the Avengers intimately, so much so that you won't feel that you know them any less than you would if they each had their own standalone movie. And out of that character emphasis comes some lovely human moments that make this more soulful and poignant than its predecessor ¬ñ how Black Widow coaxes the Hulk back into human form, that Hawkeye is an All- American family man when not on superhero duty, why Ultron is really Tony's darkest side in the flesh (or metal) gone amok, and fundamentally the burdens that each one of our superheroes carry as a consequence of their powers.<br><br>Besides Ultron, Whedon refuses to define any of the characters as ""good"" or ""bad""; rather, he identifies and illustrates their drives and impulses ¬ñ whether is it Tony's phobia or Captain America's old- fashioned sense of duty or even Ultron's Oedipal grudge ¬ñ and uses that to propel the story forward. This is ultimately how the team falls apart, going from the joviality of Thor's favourite party trick (otherwise known as ""who is fit to lift the hammer"") at the start to the infighting later on over Tony's plan to create yet another superior A.I. to defeat Ultron ¬ñ which ends up in the birth of the red-faced android named Vision (Bettany in the flesh). It is also how Whedon plots the reconciliation of the Avengers with their apparent arch-nemeses Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, no doubt laying the foundation for the next phase of the Avengers programme ¬ñ and the next two-parter instalment due three years later.<br><br>Only when it comes to matching the sheer jaw-dropping spectacle of its predecessor does this sequel become a victim of its own success. Despite hopscotching across the globe from Europe to Africa to Asia and back (culminating in the fictional East European country of Sokovia where it started), Whedon never quite achieves the same feeling of 'wow' that we had watching Loki take out S.H.I.E.L.D's airborne headquarters or unleash hell from the sky onto New York City. Whedon manage to replicate that feeling of astoundment in the much- anticipated Hulk-versus-Hulkbuster sequence, but the next to follow set in and around downtown Seoul is a major disappointment for blurry CGI and bad continuity. And though he tries to replicate the exhilaration watching the whole Avengers fighting together as an entire team, Whedon doesn't quite get our hearts leaping during the final standoff against hordes of replica Ultrons. <br><br>If the finale lacks the emotional payoff of the first movie, that's also because Whedon had set himself up with a near impossible task in the first place. That probably explains why the 'Age of Ultron' is at its core a very different movie from the first 'Avengers', not just because of how our superheroes evolve in the face of imminent destruction precipitated by one of their own but also because of the complex psychological themes that Whedon explores here. His ambition is certainly admirable, but it is inevitable that those looking for the same straightforward thrills as its predecessor will be at least slightly disappointed. That said, this is still an outstanding feat by any measure, a riveting blend of intimate character moments and grand action spectacle that remains quite simply, Marvel-lous.",22 April 2015

It manages to be action-packed, dramatic and even very funny in all the right places.<br><br>After the Avengers lead a successful raid against a Hydra outpost, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) revives his secret peacekeeping program Ultron (voiced by James Spader) to help safeguard the planet from evil. However, Ultron interprets the idea of keeping Earth safe as a need to eradicate humankind from existence. Ultron shortly escapes from Stark's laboratory to act out its mission and it's up to the Avengers, along with their new allies, the twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) to stop Ultron from carrying out this genocidal act.<br><br>Even though it is darker than the first film, Avengers: The Age of Ultron is still able to capture the charm and humour from its main characters that we have grown to love over the years. Tony Stark is still as witty as ever, delivering his trademark hilarious one-liners and Hawkeye's (Jeremy Renner) scenes have some of the most poignant moments in any Marvel film. But perhaps the biggest surprise were the twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who played a much more important role than I thought they would. There's rarely a dull moment.<br><br>I rate it 9/10, a bit higher than its predecessor, which I rated 8.5/10.",15 October 2015
96,"Movie Review:  ""Avengers:  Age of Ultron""",griffolyon12,"Lightning rarely strikes twice and that is the first thing you've got to understand about Avengers: Age of Ultron. The Avengers was one of those one of a kind movie-going experiences, and while I don't think Age of Ultron ever tops its predecessor, it is a really awesome movie in its own right. Filled with wall-to-wall action and more probing character exploration, Age of Ultron is what Serenity was to Firefly (pardon the Joss Whedon comparisons, but the guy did write and direct all of the aforementioned films and TV series). Age of Ultron is darker and more serious-minded than The Avengers, and yet there are enough one-liners and awesome comic book panel-worthy moments of mayhem that keep the film entertaining and a fitting kick-off to the Summer of 2015.<br><br>In Age of Ultron, Tony Stark creates an artificial intelligence known as Ultron in hopes of being able to establish a peacekeeper for Earth that would make the Avengers obsolete. Of course, as with just about everything Tony Stark seems to touch, things go awry and Ultron takes possession of a series of robotic bodies and believes that the only way to true peace is through evolution, which means the demise of all human life on Earth, especially those pesky Avengers. What follows is this ragtag team that we saw come together in the first film falls apart and then has to rebuild themselves all while duking it out with Ultron and a pair of superpowered twins from Eastern Europe, Quiksilver and Scarlet Witch, who have allied themselves with Ultron.<br><br>The greatest thing about Age of Ultron is it further cements the idea that these Marvel movies have really become like one really big TV series that you just have to wait every six months or so for each new episode. These things have very much become a machine with each entry being as impressively put together as the last, and when you couple that with the comfort of seeing characters you know and love reunited and bickering with one another, there is no way on Earth that you cannot enjoy the film.<br><br>Seriously, if you are reading this, you're not really wanting a full lowdown because you are already going to see the movie regardless, so what do you really need to know? All you need to know is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is worthy of the Marvel brand. It is entertainment of the highest order with a story that manages to further challenge our heroes and force them to really decide where their priorities lie. While majority of the Marvel heroes did not want to become heroes, they did rise to the challenge when called because of a sense of responsibility, and the way Age of Ultron ends effectively answers the internal question that each of our heroes face. So what are you waiting for, get to the theater and see this movie as many times as you know you're going to see it.",30 April 2015
97,I nearly fell asleep,Amanda Carley,"I loved the first Avengers, I thought it was well-casted, well-paced and overall a very enjoyable film. This movie really disappointed me. It felt rushed, inconsistent and worst of all: way too long!<br><br>The first complaint I have is the forced romance between Black Widow and The Hulk. DId anybody else think that felt so unnecessary? Especially after watching the endless flirting between her and Captain America in Winter Solider? Very inconsistent, and frankly added nothing to the movie.<br><br>My next complaint is the Scarlet Witch. Talk about nepotism at its finest. This character is so mis-cast any other actress on the planet could have done a better job. Her accent was on and off, and at some point she was channeling the matrix with her forced acting, which is a shame considering Quicksilver was great.<br><br>The movie had terrible pacing. The opening scene made no sense, and was barely explained. How did the Hydra outpost have possession of the scepter? It was so rushed it was very easy to get lost. It picks up with over-done CGI sequences, then slows down with the cast chopping wood and trying to life Thor's hammer. The plot pacing made no sense at all, and the result was a dragged-out, almost 3-hour long mess.<br><br>My biggest disappointment with the entire film, however: Ultron. The lamest, most boring and terrible super-villain ever created. In my opinion, Ultron is even lamer than Batman and Robin's Victor Fries. Ultron is the type of villain that could easily be defeated in one 20- minute cartoon episode. Here we have a villain with endless connections and apparently the greatest AI in the world, and all he does is try to blow stuff up. Ultron had the ability to really cause an uncontrollable amount of chaos, and did nothing of the sort. Not to mention there was little to no development given to the character. Why did he hate the Avengers so much? There wasn't even enough time to form a relationship with his creator or any of the Avengers for that matter.<br><br>I sincerely hope Infinity War makes an effort to be much better than Age of Ultron. This movie is a total CGI-porno and snooze fest. There are so many more reasons why AOU fell short of it's predecessor, but I won't keep going.<br><br>I rarely write bad reviews, but this was a complete and total disappointment.",20 July 2015
98,"Great , Fun Movie",americaowe,"I went to see the new Avengers movie the opening weekend. There was a packed theater and you could feel the excitement. I heard many Ooos and AHss during the movie as well as laughter during the funny moments. I liked the movie not only for the obvious content but also for the many surprises and ""Easter eggs"" spread around for the comic book fans. I was very happy that the X-Mens Magnetos children, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were in it. Marvel was not allowed to call them mutants in the movie by agreement with Fox studios. Their first appearance in the comic books were in the Uncanny X-Men #4 back in 1963.I felt this was a fantastic move in the right direction for the marvel universe. Fans even got to see the high rise building under construction that was used on the cover of the Fantastic Four # 26 when the FF teamed up with the Avengers to fight the Hulk. So, those seemingly small things put in by marvel put in throughout the movie is the reason some critics rated the movie average as opposed to those who rated it great; many people simply did not understand what was going on in the plot or in the background, hence causing confusion and in some cases even disappointment. Why does marvel do this? Because they are confident telling their stories in their own way. And marvel of course, set up the next Avengers movie by showing a villain a few minutes into the final credits. In closing, I recommend seeing this movie at the theater as soon as possible and maybe even watching it again at a later date to absorb it all.",9 May 2015

100,"Are you a fan of well characters? If so, then DON'T SEE THIS",eight88-2,"*Spoiler Free* <br><br>I just watched Age of Ulrton and I'm still in shock. It was complete trash! I have never been so tempted to start yelling in the movie theatre. Even the guy next to me was sighing in exasperation at the trash packed 2 hours and 21 minutes we suffered through.<br><br>It was the equivalent of a very OOC (Out of Character), poorly written and unedited fanfic that I wasn't able to backspace out of.<br><br>I am so profoundly disappointed and filled with rage.<br><br>I think what makes it even worse is that I recently watched Netflix's Daredevil, which had such rich characters, and then I watched Age of Ulrton and there was no mistaking or excusing the poorly written characters. The movie was bad, but against the memory of Daredevil it was even more of a let down. We had 13 hours of a brilliant story and characters with Daredevil and Age of Ultron couldn't even manage 2 hours and 21 minutes without completing screwing it up. There are brilliant Marvel works out there, but Age of Ultron is not one of them, not even close.<br><br>Lesson learned, I will not be watching any other movies that Joss Whedon writes alone. The first Avengers was fantastic, but that was also written with Zak Penn, not just Joss Whedon, so that explains it all I suppose. I grew up watching Buffy (and I still adore Firefly) so of course I wanted to love this movie, but the writing was horrible and I couldn't even slightly like this.<br><br>Age of Ulron is the ""Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" of the Avengers verse.

101,Age of Ultron: AWESOME,natygance,"So..Let me start off by saying that,being a huge fan of Avengers and its first movie, I was nervous. Nervous because I wasn't sure about the Twins, whether I would like them or not, and because the first movie was so great that it was hard to picture a better one. Well..I was wrong!!so wrong. This movie is one of those you need to see more than once. The characters are,as usual,amazing, but they've evolved since Avengers and are much,much better. In Avengers it felt that some members of the team were more important than others, in this movie they're all equally awesome in their own ways. The action..THE ACTION, from beginning to end is non-stop, the movie begins and ends with action scenes,one better than the previous one. And lastly, the comic reliefs, I remember laughing plenty in Avengers but in this movie it's one joke after the other and they're all awesome! There were some people who complained about all the sneak peaks,saying that it showed too much, let me tell you,you will encounter a lot of things in the movie that you probably weren't expecting, in a good way. One piece of advice: What Whedon said is true, there is no after- credit scene(I stayed till the end just to be sure)but there is one AMAZING mid- credit scene. So,grab your popcorn and enjoy what will most likely be the best movie of the year!I plan to rewatch it many times.",23 April 2015
102,Better then I could have imagined .,chrishayes737,"I saw Age of Ultron last night here in New Zealand yes that's right U.S.A I saw it on the 22nd of April ! and OMG this goes up a level on the last Avengers , if I could rate it higher than 10 then I would...it's blew me away especially when the Avengers had to get recruit 3 more Avengers just to beat Ultron &amp; Ultron is the coolest villain you have ever seen &amp; superbly voiced by Spader . All the gang is at their best &amp; the humor is excellent &amp; just the right amount , the action is amazing &amp; the cgi looks fantastic...Hawke eye's role is expanded &amp; we learn a lot more about him &amp; we also learn more about Black Widow &amp; I love the romance between her &amp; Hulk . Age of Ultron also sets up Civil War &amp; Infinity war so buckle in those should be just as awesome .",22 April 2015
103,"Action followed by action then, surprisingly, some character development. Then some more action.",siderite,"So everybody must be asking now: ""Is it worth watching more than two hours of this just to get to the obligatory Thanos end credits scene?"" and the answer is... yes. Besides making fun of War Machine - again - and completely ignoring characters like Pepper Potts and Falcon, there was nothing that bothered me tremendously about this film. Keep in mind that it is a comic book film with superheros that dress funny, though.<br><br>The villain is pretty menacing, the interaction between the Avengers goes well beyond killing enemies in each other's blind spot and the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver addition was interesting, though kind of condescending. I mean, if they want to ban Tin-tin cartoons for racist depictions of African people, they should stop at one moment or another inventing countries with Slavic names and filling them with helpless women and children with names just as ridiculous and toy soldier police and army forces. I am just saying.<br><br>What I thought was better than I was expecting from an Avengers movie were the underlying character stories. Thanks to Scarlet Witch we see bits of our heros' histories, we get to know Hawkeye a little better and understand his role in a team of superpowered individuals, he see the romantic side of Black Widow and the Hulk... yes, you read that right... and we get to see Captain America and Tony Stark having ideological arguments that divide the team. Of course, they carry them with vibranium shield throws and energy beams, like men do... don't they?<br><br>I loved the character of The Vision, a freak hybrid between a servile AI and a full psycho AI, holding the power of an Infinity Stone and having a 3D printed body that is half alive, half vibranium. I share his view of humanity as queer pets that you have to enjoy during their short life.<br><br>What I didn't like is that they upped the ante of what the Avengers can do, just because they could. In the end this diminished the level of empathy that one can feel for superhumans like that and removed from the quality of storytelling. Also, another film in which artificial intelligence builds bodies and kills people. Why would it? Ultron's motivation was completely unexplored and his philosophy and references to Pinocchio made no sense at all. OK, it was meant to be insane, but even insanity has purpose and sense. Overall, I think the biggest problem with the film was that it had too much of a budget.<br><br>Bottom line: brainless fun, but fun nonetheless. Less humor than expected, with Ultron teasing an interesting character with his jokes, but then devolving to a classic villain in the sea of special effects that filled most of the movie. You get to know the Avengers more, as well, which was nice.",21 August 2015
104,"Whedon had an impossible task, but he pulls through and exceeds expectations.",drawlife,"Soon after the first Avengers film was released, I could not wait for a sequel, and finally it's here, and it's all I could have hoped for. They're back with a few new additions, and finally a worthy(my favorite villain in the comics) foe, Ultron an AI bent on destroying humanity, at the same time putting the team in despair. <br><br>I'll start with some of the nitpicks. This is very rare, but I think Age of Ultron could have used an extra 10-15 minutes. Whedon in an interview stated he cut out some back story for the twins, which I think was a mistake, I wasn't particularly fond of them in the beginning, but as the film progressed they grew on me a lot. This time around Whedon brings a butt-load of action, and better action I might add, but while in the first film there were moments that lasted too long to take a breather from the action, in Age of Ultron he doesn't allow us a moment to catch our breath too often, very sporadically. <br><br>But, he finds away to keep things interesting. Barely shorter than the first film, it's still a long film regardless and it does not feel like it. This time around Whedon allows The Avengers to be The Avengers. They're together a lot more and their dynamic and relationship is a joy to watch. The original six, Downey Jr., Evans, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Johansson, and Renner are all fantastic. Johansson's Black Widow and Renner's Hawkeye in particular have quite an impressive arc in this film and an argument can be made that Hawkeye is the main character, there's also a brilliant, fun tongue in cheek moment he has with Scarlet Witch. Also he got the best lines in the film aside from James Spader who by the way is an excellent villain. <br><br>Ultron in this film has a personality. He is a scene stealer and commands the screen every time he's in it. He's got some humor, but I would have liked more menace within him. There are two moments where he became very threatening, and the film could have used a bit more. Although his plan for destruction is quite impactful and quite intimidating, he sorta feels lost, as do some of the characters because the film is so saturated and overstuffed to a degree. <br><br>I'd also like to mention that Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders serve their roles well, but in a populated film like this they're roles are obviously reduced a bit, and to my surprise Don Cheadle's War Machine finally gets some action, despite it being small. <br><br>The new additions Elizabeth Olsen, Aaron Johnson, and Paul Bettany are solid and only bring extra flare into the film's ingredients. Scarlet Witch is quite well realized, a little more than Quicksilver I might I add, and she is fun to watch and causes some inner damage to the team. Speaking of Quicksilver, Whedon wisely tries not to match or outdo the X-Men Quicksilver, and in doing so he's more grounded and a little more developed than Singer's, who just used him for an impressive sequence. Paul Bettany's Vision is also another scene stealer. He was incredible in the film, and as a last minute surprise he does not disappoint. Vision is arguably one of my favorite characters growing up and Whedon works him into the film the way I'd hope it be. Kudos to Whedon. <br><br>I mentioned the action before in my nitpicks, but the action here is top notch and Whedon finds a way to keep you focused. A lot of teamwork is involved in almost every action set piece and you feel what's at stake as the team also takes cue to actually save civilians. It's just a fireworks of action displayed on screen and the scale of it is so very impressive. Hulkbuster vs Hulk in particular is a standout sequence, as does everything that has to do with Vision. But aside from the action, Whedon manages to juggle every single character and somehow make them as relevant as they can be, some obviously more than others, but it's just amazing to see it all unfold. He understands these characters as the heavy moments work well and he never forgets the heroes' humanity. There are also hints to films in the future, but they don't saturate the main plot, but enough to keep you aware. <br><br>Joss Whedon had an incredible challenge to make a sequel to the first film. I think one can argue that the novelty wore off a bit because in the first film, it was something that was never been seen before and as it was released it was, and I use the term ""done already,"" and going into this sequel, it won't be able to recapture that magic of the first because ""it's been done already."" <br><br>I know I sound like I'm fanboying, and that's because I am(no apologizes), but if you overlook all that, the film is as good as it gets. It's almost impossible to make a movie like this and not have it feel repetitive. Not to mention, it's impossible to have so many characters and have a completely satisfying characterization for all of them, and I think in the hands of another filmmaker who not only writes, but also directs would more or less likely fail. <br><br>Joss got the job done, but one can notice corporate meddling was taken place, as it is a big crowd drawing film for everyone. I think the Russo's and the writing team of Markus and McFeely are the prefect candidates to take over the glorious Avenger films. I believe they nail the darker tone a lot better than anyone else. The film has no end-credits stinger, but stick around for the mid-credit scene. It's so good. <br><br>7.5/10",22 April 2015
105,"Great sequel, not at all disappointing",liamsofficial,"This movie was fantastic. Great action sequences, great heroes, great villains, great jokes. All around this was a great sequel. Was it as good as the first Avengers film, yes and its probably even better. Each character is given more time to develop, especially Hawkeye and Bruce Banner/The Hulk who are characters who were not very utilised in the previous film. Also I would say Hawkeye was the character this film focused on the most and nicely tied it together. The new characters Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were also great, and the accents were not at all distracting as others had said. The Vision, was probably the coolest addition to this film and he is introduced in a very cool way and its great that he is now a part of the MCU, Paul Bettany did a great job. Ultron, the villain of this film has been getting a lot of hate. But Ultron was great in this film. he was very human, he had so many different characteristics that made him a great character. Many viewers wanted him to be menacing and scary and that's all, but all that will accomplish is another dull MCU villain. Also the jokes in this film were completely fine. None of them pulled me out of the action, I was completely into the movie this whole time. Nothing made me look away and go, why did they do that? So really just go see this movie, ignore all the haters because this is a great addition to the MCU and you wont be disappointed. Just enjoy it and try not to pick it apart.",24 April 2015

I like how I was able to see the other side of some characters. I like how they are bringing in other avengers to keep this going, and those of you that are complaining about this you should have known seeing that there are a lot of avengers in the comics and cartoon so get over it. I was a little worried that it would not live up to the first movie but I must say to me it did. I was able to see more of Black Widow, Hawk, exceptionally Hulk the emotions that he had even when he was not Bruce Banner was a very nice touch. Bringing in Rody was cool too.

107,An old dog with fleas,digitalbeachbum,"Age of Ultron is a tiresome flick. The characters are the same as expected but Iron Man has become more snobbish and self centered.

The writers have had to change his character because, uncontrolled, he becomes a loose canon. You can't give him any real dialog. Which ruins the character for me because I grew up with him being this blind rage of power going off to smash puny bad guys while saving good people who are scared of him.<br><br>Marvel has become this lack luster pile of poop which is pushing out crappy movie after crappy movie to cash in on the popularity of comic book characters. This has caused movies like Age of Ultron to stink.<br><br>There are some serious plot holes in the script but I'm not going to dwell on it. With out them the movie is still sub-par.

Mixed with strong moral based and ethic principles, so we don't freak out. Our way of living is a modern tale, our ego is of value.
